We all have them\, but they can be scary and unpredictable. Sometimes things go well\, but other times—seemingly randomly—they devolve into bad situations. We don’t feel in control ( a lack of agency as the psychologists call it) and so it’s often easier just to do more introverted nerd stuff like reading.You are not alone. We have all been there. There is nothing wrong with you\, and it is ok. This is a safe space to explore what is going on\, to learn some techniques on how to have healthy experiences around emotions and relationships\, and to practice them.We are a couple of fellow nerds who finally got tired of the old ways and did a bunch of research\, work\, and practice to get to a place of fulfillment. Well\, not all the time; we are still works in progress. But we at least have a solid understanding and framework\, and we want to give you some shortcuts to get there too in ways that are more easily relatable to folks in the JoCo demographic. Please don’t be shy. Come and connect with your cruise mates and get more connected to yourself too!JoCo Cruise does not vet\, nor can they vouch for the qualifications of\, anyone presenting health/therapy-related Shadow Cruise events. Please exercise your best judgment if/when attending.

If you plan on attending\, it would make things easier if you email your public key hash (or the public key packet itself) to patenaude@gmail.com (key hash 1CC876F10CAC9F89).

SUMMARY:Mental Health
DESCRIPTION:Traditional data tells us that as many as one in four people suffers from some sort of mental illness\, and new studies are indicating that the percentage might be higher than that\, especially among creative communities. Come listen as panelists talk about how they came to discover that they weren't neuro-typical\, as well as sharing tips\, tricks\, and personal coping mechanisms. We work toward busting the myth of the tortured genius while being honest about how mental illness is part of our lives. Moderated by Patrick Rothfuss.
