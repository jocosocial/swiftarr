/// UserRole is a simple role-based access control mechanism mostly used for elevating 'verified' users to have specific extra access.
/// UserRole is therefore an access model that works in addition to Twitarr's priority access model (see `UserLevel`). With UserLevlels,
/// each increasing access level is a superset of access provided by the previous level. Roles allow multiple users to each extend the `verified` permissions
/// without one of the extensions always being a superset of the other.
///
/// This implementation is not a full RBAC. Instead:
/// 	- Each user may have multiple roles
/// 	- A db object or API call that requires a role to use must test that the requesting user has the proper role.
/// 	- Roles implicitly define permissions; there is no facility to add/remove permissions from roles.
/// 	- There is no role hierarchy. An operation X that allows X_User and X_Manager to access it must test for both roles explicitly.
/// 	- Ideally, a DB object that requires a role to access should only require one role be stored for it.
/// 	- In general, a nil value for a DB object's `requiredRole` should mean no special role is required to access it.
/// 	- Moderators and above should usually have access to role-protected content; without us having to add a bunch of roles to each moderator user.
