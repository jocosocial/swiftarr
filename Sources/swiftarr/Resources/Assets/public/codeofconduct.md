# JoCo Cruise Twit-arr Guidelines

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately, and will be banned from the service if they do not.

### What is Twit-arr?

- A place to connect with others, and share the joy of JoCo Cruise
- A place to share jokes and memes
- A place to ask for basic assistance or information
- A tool to assist people in self-organizing activities

### Posting Guidelines

- If you wouldn’t say it to someone in person, you shouldn’t post it on Twit-arr.
- It’s okay for people to have respectful disagreements, but anything that our moderators believe crosses the line into overly heated arguments, meanness, axe-grinding, personal beefs, etc., will result in timeouts and/or banning at our discretion.
- The use of emoji’s or images to convey inappropriate meaning consistent with the rules outlined above will be moderated.
- There are a lot of forums and the numbers grow as the cruise progresses. Please do your best to post to the most appropriate forum.
- Repeated (spam) posts will be removed, including repeated posts to the wrong forum.
- Twit-arr is not a tool for resolving customer issues, please see “Support Options” below for customer support.
- Posters seeking customer support will be directed to the appropriate support option(s) below. Repeated posts about or seeking redress for the same issue will be removed.
- Queries regarding moderation should be directed to the moderation team @moderator and not posted in-line.

### Support Options

Twit-arr is not a tool for resolving issues. Should you need assistance with an issue during 
sailing you have the following options:

- Report the concern to the Info Desk located in the Atrium on Deck 1, midships
- Speak to a Peer Reporting Organization Worker
- Report a Code of Conduct Concern by visiting the Info Desk or calling 74501 from any ship phone

## JoCo Cruise Code of Conduct

JoCo Cruise is an enthusiastic and supportive community, and it is all of our responsibility to maintain it. Please treat your fellow attendees with kindness and respect. Be welcoming, inclusive and friendly, and look out for one another. Respect common sense norms for public behavior, personal interaction, common courtesy, and respect for private property. In keeping with this guiding philosophy of Being Excellent To Each Other, during the JoCo Cruise event we require all attendees to abide by.

### Don’t harass others.

Harassing behavior includes (but isn’t limited to): any kind of physical, verbal, or psychological abuse; threats, intimidation, and bullying; slurs or discriminatory behavior regarding aspects of identity or expression, including (but not limited to) race, gender, sexuality, ability, age, body size or type, disability, neurotype, physical appearance, or religion; unwanted romantic attention, sexual harassment, and generally creepy or stalky behavior; and photographing anyone or engaging in physical interactions (hugging, tickling, backrubs, etc.) without consent. If someone asks you to stop doing something and you continue doing it, that’s harassment.

Harassment does not include respectful disagreement or critiques in good faith. This community comprises many different perspectives and identities, and we should not expect to completely agree with each other all the time. Listen carefully, and speak kindly and with respect; we all have much to learn from one another.

### Be excellent to the ship’s staff and people you encounter at ports of call.

Remember that we share this community with others. Please don’t be the person who makes us look bad to the ship’s staff and/or the locals; “don’t harass others,” as outlined above, extends to your interactions with them as well.

### Don’t steal things.

Obviously.

### Don’t use illegal substances or bring them onboard.

No exceptions.

In the event of a violation of this Code of Conduct, JoCo Cruise reserves the right to take action, including (but not limited to) limiting access to events, expulsion without refund, and/or permanent banning from JoCo Cruise events.

During the cruise, if you are subject to or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, contact any Helper or JoCo Cruise staff member. Alternately, you can submit a Code of Conduct Violation Report form at the JoCo Cruise Info Desk. (This may be done anonymously if you wish.) You can also dial 74501 from any ship’s phone. Off-ship, you can email conduct@jococruise.com. JoCo Cruise will make every effort to protect the privacy of anyone reporting a violation.
