Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy.

In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided).

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.<br\/><br\/>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.<br\/><br\/>You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately.

The canvas grows organically as you all play cards, and the edges aren't fixed until you have four (or five) cards in a row or column.

Jeor Mormont wishes to promote one who can improve the infrastructure of the Gift, the bountiful and undeveloped area south of the Wall bestowed to the Watch by the Starks thousands of years ago. Drawing sustenance from the unforgiving landscape of the north offers enough challenges, but whomever takes up this task must also man and defend the Wall against the onslaught of Wildlings fighting their way into Westeros. Many brothers now compete to build, defend, and do what they can to protect Westeros, but only one shall rise above their brothers to become the new Lord Commander. But be wary &mdash; the north holds many dangers, and winter is coming.<br\/><br\/>A Game of Thrones Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch is based on the classic Settlers of Catan base game. In this game, each area in the Gift supplies one of five resources: lumber, brick, wool, grain, and ore. The barren Ice Fields, however, produce nothing. Players take on the role of Brothers of the Night's Watch and use these resources to strengthen their hold on the north by building roads, settlements, and keeps; recruiting guards for their patrol; or buying development cards. Each of these acts bring players increased power and recognition through the awarding of victory points. The objective will be familiar to players of the original Catan; the first player to achieve ten victory points wins the game and becomes the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<br\/><br\/>But this is not as easy as it sounds as the area surrounding the Gift can be treacherous. Wildings from north of the Wall have crossed over and follow their own rules of honor, which often conflict with the laws of Westeros. One of their ranks, Tormund Giantsbane, does not respect the Watch's claim to the land as he moves throughout the Gift, robbing resources from the Brothers sent to provide for their Order. While Tormund runs amok south of the Wall, Wildling forces gather in the Frostfangs, awaiting an opportune moment of weakness to breach the Watch's defenses and spread throughout the fruitful lands of Westeros. In addition to building within the Gift, players must strategically balance their resources to defend the Realm from Wildling raiders.<br\/><br\/>Each player may recruit up to seven brothers from the prisons of Westeros to don their specific color and man their section of the Wall. When the Wildings attack, each player must use their guards to fend off the onslaught. If there are more guards than Wildings, the Wall stands. If there are not, the Wildings invade the Gift and pillage the settlements and keeps therein. Yet loyalty only goes so far &mdash; guards are useless defending the Wall from Climbers who slip past them, and if they encounter a Giant, at least one guard is bound to desert his post.<br\/><br\/>Each player also has a hero to aide in their toil, based on the order of play. The first player will utilize the talents of the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont, while the second player will enjoy the company of Samwell Tarly, the third will work with Bowen Marsh, and the fourth will employ the services of Master Builder Othell Yarwyck. Each hero offers a unique ability to each player which they can use up to twice during the game. Once a hero's ability has been used, players have a choice to keep that hero or choose another of the eleven heroes to aide them. Players should factor the heroes' abilities into their strategy to quickly earn victory points and gain renown within the Watch.<br\/><br\/>The Wildling invasion marks the truest test of the Brothers of the Watch and your own competency as a commander. A failure at the Wall has a devastating impact on the Gift, even if it does not destroy the players. A Game of Throne Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch has two forms of victory, though one may feel hollower than the other. Victory occurs when a player has both improved the infrastructure of the Gift and successfully kept it safe from invaders. This is shown when a player has achieved ten victory points by any combination of building keeps, roads, and settlements; hiring three or more guards to keep the Wall safe; and buying development cards to increase their prestige, all while safeguarding the Gift.<br\/><br\/>However, if the Wildlings breach the wall three times throughout the game, an alternate victory takes place. If this occurs, the game ends immediately as the Brotherhood of the Night's Watch can no longer delay their decision. The player commanding the most guards holding their posts on the Wall gains the title of Lord Commander and wins the game.<br\/><br\/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br\/><br\/>","complexity":2.56,"minPlayers":3,"categories":["Civilization","Negotiation","Novel-based"],"bggGameName":"A Game of Thrones: Catan – Brotherhood of the Watch","avgPlayingTime":75,"avgRating":7.14124,"numCopies":1,"minPlayingTime":60},{"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Card Game","Fantasy"],"minPlayers":2,"avgPlayingTime":30,"numRatings":4429,"complexity":1.2347,"bggGameName":"A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King","suggestedPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"gameTypes":["Family Games"],"gameDescription":"Description from the publisher:<br\/><br\/>The king has called for a lavish feast and tourney, the likes of which have not been seen in the Seven Kingdoms since the days of Aegon the Conquerer.

Players take turns adding information to a network of Polaroid photos and strings, creating a map of the murder investigation. The players will use these strings to connect a Suspect, Weapon, and Crime Scene to the Victim. Once completed, the case is ready to go to trial.<br\/><br\/>However, solving the murder investigation is simply a means to an end. The true objective of the game is to be the detective with the most Evidence Points when the central case goes to trial. When a player adds a new card to the investigation, Evidence Points are put into play on the card as it is placed. However, these are only counted towards a player's final score if those cards are used to directly link the Victim to the most relevant Leads. To succeed, players will need to undermine the credibility of their colleagues, take creative shortcuts to justice, and put their contributions to the case in the places that matter most.<br\/><br\/>","complexity":2,"suggestedPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"bggGameName":"Bad Detectives","avgPlayingTime":60,"mechanisms":["Tile Placement"]},{"categories":["Bluffing","Trivia"],"mechanisms":[],"numCopies":1,"gameName":"Balderdash Game","yearPublished":"2007","avgPlayingTime":0,"maxPlayingTime":0,"avgRating":6.65588,"gameTypes":[],"minPlayers":4,"minPlayingTime":0,"bggGameName":"Absolute Balderdash","minAge":12,"numRatings":34,"gameDescription":"Each turn a card entry is read out and every player writes down their own made up answer.

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br\/><br\/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br\/><br\/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:<br\/><br\/><br\/>    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.<br\/>    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.<br\/>    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.<br\/>    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.<br\/><br\/><br\/>In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br\/><br\/>The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.<br\/><br\/>The 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release (Shields).<br\/>This edition has one fewer double-sided Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion – Monastery Boards. It doesn't include The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion – New Player Boards, The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion – German Board Game Championship Board 2013, or The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion – German Board Game Championship Board 2016.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.<br\/><br\/>Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br\/><br\/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br\/><br\/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br\/><br\/>CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br\/><br\/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br\/><br\/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br\/><br\/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br\/><br\/>Ways to Play:<br\/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br\/><br\/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br\/><br\/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br\/><br\/>Theme:<br\/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br\/><br\/>","maxPlayingTime":60,"minPlayingTime":45,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"mechanisms":["Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Open Drafting","Race"],"gameName":"Catan: Rivals for Catan","bggGameName":"Rivals for Catan","avgPlayingTime":60,"minAge":10,"suggestedPlayers":2,"categories":["Card Game","City Building","Medieval","Territory Building"],"avgRating":6.94692,"numCopies":2,"gameTypes":["Strategy Games"],"yearPublished":"2010","complexity":2.3219},{"gameDescription":"Twenty years ago, the settlers started into the depths of the galaxy to discover unknown planets, the undiscovered universe lying before them. Maybe they'll find planets with good ore or carbon deposits &mdash; or perhaps only barren ice planets. They might encounter alien folks and start lucrative trading, with pirates and wormholes being a constant challenge for them.<br\/><br\/>Catan: Starfarers is a new version of Starfarers of Catan, originally released in 1999, that contains completely revised graphics and game materials, revised rules, and (most importantly) a variable game board that brings even more variety to the exploration of space.<br\/><br\/>Changes to the mechanics include<br\/><br\/>-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll. Two random cards initially, then one, then none as your victory points go up. This is a nice touch. No matter how unlucky you are you still get something. Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck.<br\/><br\/>- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards. Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e. three of one for one of any other type. Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1. This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.<br\/><br\/>- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type. But you have to get there early. Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own.<br\/><br\/>- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades. They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game. Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.<br\/><br\/>- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die. I think this actually works better.<br\/><br\/>Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system. This is the same as building towns in Catan. But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count. In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system. In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.  If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems. Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map.<br\/><br\/>","categories":["Exploration","Negotiation","Science Fiction","Space Exploration"],"avgRating":7.55934,"mechanisms":["Hexagon Grid","Modular Board","Trading","Variable Set-up"],"complexity":2.5238,"minPlayers":3,"yearPublished":"2019","suggestedPlayers":3,"minAge":14,"numRatings":1463,"expands":"Catan","numCopies":1,"maxPlayingTime":120,"avgPlayingTime":120,"maxPlayers":4,"gameTypes":["Family Games"],"minPlayingTime":120,"gameName":"Catan: Starfarers","bggGameName":"CATAN: Starfarers"},{"bggGameName":"Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome","minPlayers":3,"minAge":10,"numRatings":1443,"complexity":2.5436,"avgRating":6.42883,"mechanisms":["Area Movement","Trading"],"gameDescription":"Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome is a new Settlers of Catan game.

Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?<br\/><br\/>In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:<br\/><br\/><br\/>    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round.

The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.<br\/><br\/>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.<br\/><br\/>Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.<br\/><br\/>You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.<br\/><br\/>At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!<br\/><br\/>","yearPublished":"2014","gameTypes":["Family Games"],"minPlayers":2,"categories":["American West","Fighting","Trains"],"minPlayingTime":40,"numRatings":32317},{"minPlayers":2,"bggGameName":"Come Together","complexity":0,"numRatings":15,"categories":["Mature \/ Adult"],"maxPlayers":4,"gameTypes":[],"minPlayingTime":0,"gameName":"Come Together","gameDescription":"Players explore what fetishes their partner might be into while trying to guess what they will actually be.

Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. <br\/> As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.<br\/><br\/>The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province.

Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!<br\/><br\/>Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.<br\/><br\/>The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)<br\/><br\/>The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.<br\/><br\/>Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.<br\/><br\/>You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.<br\/><br\/>After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.<br\/><br\/>","minPlayers":2,"numRatings":3208,"numCopies":1,"suggestedPlayers":3,"minAge":8},{"gameName":"Council of Verona","minAge":13,"mechanisms":["Auction\/Bidding","Hand Management","Open Drafting"],"numCopies":1,"maxPlayers":5,"gameDescription":"The citizens of Verona have grown tired of the constant quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague.

Once all dice are assigned players reveal an attack card for each monster then resolve attacks from the lowest to the highest value of card or die. Enemies target the hero that has an assigned die that is equal to or greater than their attack card value.

Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.<br\/><br\/>There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.<br\/>The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.<br\/><br\/>A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.<br\/><br\/>When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br\/><br\/>Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br\/><br\/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br\/><br\/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br\/><br\/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br\/><br\/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br\/><br\/>","numCopies":2},{"gameTypes":[],"gameName":"Epic Encounters: Lair of the Red Dragon","categories":[],"mechanisms":[],"numCopies":1},{"categories":[],"gameTypes":[],"gameName":"Epic Encounters: Shrine of the Kobold Queen","mechanisms":[],"numCopies":1},{"numCopies":1,"maxPlayingTime":30,"gameTypes":[],"avgPlayingTime":30,"minPlayingTime":30,"complexity":0,"bggGameName":"Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Anarchy at the Arena","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"gameDescription":"Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Anarchy at the Arena is a standalone game that can also be combined with any other title in the Epic Spell Wars series.

Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to hasten doom...before it's too late!<br\/><br\/>During the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to do one of two things to aid their cult in their mission: Use the spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, or use the symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready a spell. Readied spells can be cast at any time, but while in a cult's Spell Reserve their primary Astral Symbol can aid in readying future spells, creating an engine for pumping out more potential power.<br\/><br\/>As cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As cults send more and more cultists to a location, they may gain control there, adding even more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful how they navigate Arkham as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, placing Elder Signs, and generally getting in the way of summoning your Elder God. Gain too many Elder Signs and it's game over!<br\/><br\/>If any cult can manage to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win!

Most fire fighting games have a cooperative aspect with players working together to beat back the flames, but in Fire Tower your only objectives are to protect your own tower and spread the blaze towards your opponents. The game plays 2-4 players, ages 12+, and takes 15+ minutes. Action cards allow players to alter the direction of the wind, and add varying patterns of fire, water, and defensive barriers to the board. The skill comes in effectively directing the resources in your hand and using sound spatial planning to deploy them.<br\/><br\/>The game incorporates an intuitive play structure that takes minutes to learn and requires negligible set-up. Each card includes a grid that visually explains the ways it can be used,  saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rulebook.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.<br\/><br\/>What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.<br\/><br\/>With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.<br\/> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.<br\/><br\/>From the publisher's website:<br\/><br\/>Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step!

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.<br\/><br\/>The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.<br\/><br\/>To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.<br\/><br\/>To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.<br\/><br\/>There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.<br\/><br\/>","avgPlayingTime":60,"complexity":2.904,"gameTypes":["Strategy Games"],"numRatings":21310,"numCopies":1,"suggestedPlayers":4,"minAge":12,"yearPublished":"2008"},{"gameName":"Ghostel","maxPlayers":4,"minPlayingTime":60,"avgRating":7.08228,"minAge":14,"suggestedPlayers":4,"mechanisms":["Dice Rolling","Worker Placement"],"categories":["Dice"],"avgPlayingTime":60,"gameTypes":["Family Games"],"gameDescription":"Ghostel is a semi-cooperative family game for 2-4 players that plays in 60 minutes.<br\/><br\/>Prey on the phobias of guests by turning into their worst nightmares.

There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br\/><br\/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br\/><br\/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br\/><br\/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br\/><br\/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br\/><br\/>According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks\/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.<br\/><br\/>","maxPlayingTime":20,"numCopies":1,"categories":["Action \/ Dexterity","Party Game"],"avgRating":5.64853},{"minAge":8,"gameTypes":["Family Games"],"mechanisms":["Race","Real-Time","Solo \/ Solitaire Game","Tile Placement"],"maxPlayingTime":20,"avgRating":6.52001,"numCopies":1,"gameName":"Jetpack Joyride","gameDescription":"Jetpack Joyride is a real-time competitive puzzle game adapted from the mobile game of the same name!

But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br\/><br\/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.

Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br\/><br\/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong.

The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.<br\/><br\/>At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him\/her the winner.<br\/><br\/>The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance.

Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!<br\/><br\/>The game board is broken into 6 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.<br\/><br\/>The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.<br\/><br\/>The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.<br\/><br\/>Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.<br\/><br\/>Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.<br\/><br\/>Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17.

In order to score attractions in your zoo, you must keep a maintenance truck next to the attraction.<br\/><br\/>While visiting your zoo, guests will need to get around.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.<br\/><br\/>Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.<br\/><br\/>In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.<br\/><br\/>Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.<br\/><br\/>After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.<br\/><br\/>If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.<br\/><br\/>Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.<br\/><br\/>If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

With the playing deck, each player has a &quot;formation card&quot; to show you how your &quot;body&quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).<br\/><br\/>To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).<br\/><br\/>Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.<br\/><br\/>1. Get tattooed:<br\/>This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.<br\/><br\/><br\/>    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.<br\/><br\/><br\/>2. Open play:<br\/>This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players.

Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.<br\/><br\/>Combining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.<br\/><br\/>Simply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes. In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders.<br\/><br\/>Take on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team's chances to protect against the invaders. Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!<br\/><br\/>Pandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes.

In the game, you take on the role of an independent Puerto Rican farmer in this new era and compete against others to hire workers to grow, sell, and trade valuable crops. You will also be in charge of resurrecting parts of the country as you attempt to build vital city infrastructure. Your goal throughout the game is to acquire more wealth and prestige than your opponents and become the most prosperous farmer across the country. Each player has their own small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br\/><br\/>Puerto Rico 1897 uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops that they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not function unless they are staffed by workers.<br\/><br\/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action associated with that role. The player who selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so; for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, and the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br\/><br\/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for occupied &quot;large buildings&quot;. Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players, and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br\/><br\/>Puerto Rico 1897 includes four expansions.<br\/><br\/>","maxPlayingTime":120,"gameTypes":[],"avgPlayingTime":120},{"avgPlayingTime":120,"maxPlayers":2,"avgRating":6.54194,"complexity":2.25,"mechanisms":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Movement Points","Ratio \/ Combat Results Table","Simulation","Zone of Control"],"numCopies":3,"yearPublished":"2008","bggGameName":"An Loc: 1972 – The North Vietnamese Push Towards Saigon","minPlayingTime":120,"gameDescription":"An LPS bonus mini-game.<br\/><br\/>April 1972; a Young US Army captain watched a stream of ARVN fugitives screaming &quot;Thiet Giap!&quot; ; &quot;Tank!&quot; in Vietnamese.

As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br\/><br\/>Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!<br\/><br\/>"},{"gameTypes":[],"mechanisms":["Deck, Bag, and Pool Building","Dice Rolling"],"avgPlayingTime":30,"minAge":14,"expands":"Quarriors!","suggestedPlayers":4,"avgRating":7.30893,"minPlayers":2,"categories":["Expansion for Base-game","Dice","Fantasy","Fighting"],"gameName":"Quarriors!

As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements.

Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!<br\/><br\/>To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:<br\/><br\/><br\/>     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color.

There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away.

Savernake forest is a game where 2-4 players build their own section of the forest with paths where animals and food will appear. To get the highest score, players must ensure that on each path the animals can collect their favorite food.<br\/><br\/>Foxes, hedgehogs, beavers, owls, rabbits, woodpeckers, wild cats... Up to 23 different types of animals live together in the Savernake Forest. At the end of autumn, they all prepare to spend the cold winter with enough provisions and here you are to give them a hand&hellip; Or a paw! To play Savernake Forest you have two decks of square cards, one showing the animals and the other with forest paths full of succulent food. Each player is randomly given an animal card, showing how many foods they can store and their preferences. For example, the fox loves eggs, but not berries or nuts. To get the best score, you must try to get each animal to collect its favorite foods.<br\/><br\/>During setup, three road cards and one animal card are laid out for all players to see. Each player, on his turn, will choose one of them and add it to his forest, always respecting three rules: there can never be two animals on the same path; cards must be adjacent and no cards can be placed outside of a 4x4 grid. The game ends when all participants have completed their forest, with a total of 16 cards.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the game, players will have the help of some animals, depending on the card they choose from the central market. The rooster will help you get up early, so you can be the first to choose a card in the next turn. The armadillo teaches you how to dig better shelters to store more food, so you can take a burrow token and add it to one of your animal cards to increase that animal's storage capacity by 1. The goat teaches you to hydrate yourself better, offering a water drop token that can be associated with a food and increase its value by 1. Finally, the rabbit helps you attract new animals to your forest.<br\/><br\/>For players looking for more advanced challenges, the rulebook includes a two-player variant with some modifications that increase the difficulty. Quite a boost if you already master the basic rules!<br\/><br\/>With a dreamy art, Savernake Forest offers a perfect balance between fun and strategy that makes it perfect for any type of playgroup.

A system of viable exoplanets has been recently discovered and the Confederations are flocking into space to colonize it. In this 2 to 4-player development and flow-management board game, you play the leader of one of these Confederations and play your influence in the Odyssey command station to send as many of your settlers as you can on these exoplanets.<br\/><br\/>After decades of research and technological development, humanity is preparing to leave the Earth to colonize this discovered system. To get there, only one possible means of transport exists: space gates. For reasons related to physics and other quantum aspects, these gates can be built only in space. The Confederations have therefore embarked on the construction of their own station in orbit, equipped with space gates.<br\/><br\/>At the beginning of the colonizing era, these portals make it possible to go on one of the first three discovered planets. As soon as an entire contingent of settlers has joined the gate of a space station, it is teleported to the corresponding exoplanet. The landing conditions vary according to the planets and the choice of colonized spots quickly becomes strategic.<br\/><br\/>As soon as one of the three exoplanets is fully colonized, each Confederation gains influence according to its placement, then access to one of the two later discovered exoplanets becomes possible. At the end of the colonization of the five exoplanets, the stations are teleported to the Hawking planet and the influence of each Confederation is assessed. The leader of the most influential Confederation will be promoted to the rank of Governor of this new system.<br\/><br\/>One of the biggest challenges in Space Gate Odyssey is your ability to quickly develop and intelligently arrange your space station. The better you optimize the flow of your settlers to your station, then to the exoplanets, the more of them you can send to the favorable spots and thus gain influence.<br\/><br\/>The choice of the modules, their arrangement, and the distance between the airlocks and the gates are therefore essential elements &mdash; especially since, at the end of the game, the domains of the modules you used to build your station will bring you additional influence points if they are in line with the position of the domains on the Hawking planet Predominance.<br\/><br\/>Finally, you must be careful not to leave too many open corridors on the space void as this represents a real danger for your settlers and could therefore damage your reputation.<br\/><br\/>Your most amazing quest starts with Space Gate Odyssey.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br\/><br\/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how \/ whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br\/><br\/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br\/><br\/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br\/><br\/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br\/><br\/>","gameTypes":["Strategy Games"],"suggestedPlayers":2,"bggGameName":"Spirit Island","minPlayingTime":90,"maxPlayingTime":120,"numCopies":2,"minAge":13,"numRatings":51562,"maxPlayers":4,"avgPlayingTime":120,"yearPublished":"2017","gameName":"Spirit Island","categories":["Environmental","Fantasy","Fighting","Mythology","Territory Building"],"minPlayers":1,"avgRating":8.34419,"complexity":4.0667},{"mechanisms":["Contracts","Open Drafting","Race","Set Collection"],"maxPlayingTime":30,"gameDescription":"Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development.

Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win).

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br\/><br\/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br\/><br\/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.<br\/><br\/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)<br\/><br\/>Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.<br\/><br\/>Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.<br\/><br\/>Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.<br\/><br\/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br\/><br\/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board.

A base point is the location of a pillar or junction constructed in previous turn. The height of the pillar must be 1 above or 1 below the base point. You may not construct a pillar of the same height, 2 stories above or below the height of a base point (following is an exception - 6.

To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent&rsquo;s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent&rsquo;s road: crossing over or crossing under it.<br\/><br\/>When crossing over : <br\/>there exist no other roads over opponent&rsquo;s road<br\/><br\/>When crossing under : <br\/>there exist no other roads under opponent&rsquo;s road<br\/><br\/>When either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway.

Using a junction, you may do the following.<br\/><br\/>① Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number<br\/>You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.<br\/><br\/>Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!<br\/><br\/>② Branching out to two-ways<br\/>You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.<br\/><br\/>Constructing Exit to Highway<br\/><br\/>If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.<br\/><br\/>Penalty<br\/><br\/>If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.<br\/><br\/>End of the Game<br\/><br\/>1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway<br\/>The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.<br\/><br\/>2.

Kennedy<br\/><br\/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br\/><br\/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br\/><br\/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation.

The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.<br\/><br\/>Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.<br\/><br\/>If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!<br\/><br\/>At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as &quot;Food Rationing&quot;, call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as &quot;Hull Leak&quot;, call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.<br\/><br\/>During a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.<br\/><br\/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br\/><br\/>","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayingTime":240,"minAge":14,"suggestedPlayers":5,"avgRating":7.51792,"maxPlayers":6,"gameName":"Unfathomable","categories":["Bluffing","Deduction","Fantasy","Horror","Novel-based"],"yearPublished":"2021","minPlayingTime":120,"mechanisms":["Area Movement","Hand Management","Hidden Roles","Team-Based Game","Traitor Game","Variable Player Powers"],"avgPlayingTime":240,"numRatings":5324,"complexity":3.0864,"gameTypes":["Thematic Games"],"bggGameName":"Unfathomable","numCopies":1},{"maxPlayingTime":40,"minPlayers":2,"yearPublished":"2019","gameDescription":"In battle, there are no equals.<br\/><br\/>Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players.

It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.<br\/><br\/>In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br\/><br\/>In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:<br\/><br\/><br\/>     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.<br\/>     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.<br\/><br\/>During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.<br\/><br\/>","maxPlayingTime":60,"gameName":"Warsaw City of Ruins","mechanisms":["Closed Drafting","Simultaneous Action Selection","Tile Placement"],"minPlayingTime":45},{"bggGameName":"Waterfall Park","gameName":"Waterfall Park","maxPlayingTime":45,"maxPlayers":5,"avgRating":7.09924,"avgPlayingTime":45,"numCopies":1,"gameDescription":"Welcome to Waterfall Park.

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.<br\/><br\/>Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.<br\/><br\/>One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.<br\/><br\/>The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.<br\/><br\/>The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.<br\/><br\/>The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other.

One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.<br\/><br\/>Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.<br\/><br\/>The origin date listed for this game is approximate.<br\/><br\/>","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"complexity":1.9027},{"yearPublished":"2010","maxPlayingTime":20,"minPlayers":2,"minAge":10,"complexity":1.0942,"maxPlayers":99,"numCopies":2,"categories":["Dice","Horror","Humor","Party Game","Zombies"],"avgRating":6.23002,"gameTypes":["Party Games"],"gameDescription":"Eat brains.

Three Sisters is named after an indigenous agricultural technique still widely used today in which three different crops &mdash; pumpkins, corn, and beans &mdash; are planted close together. Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb, the beans bring nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the squash provides a natural mulch ground cover to reduce weeds and keep pests away.<br\/><br\/>In the game, you have your own player sheet with multiple areas: the garden, which is divided into six numbered zones, each containing the three crop types; the apiary; compost; perennials; goods; fruit; and the shed, which is filled with tools that have special abilities. All the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you acquire these items. Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way. A common feature of these tracks are circles that represent a harvest, which generates goods; get enough goods, and you unlock bonus actions. Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses.<br\/><br\/>The game lasts eight rounds. Each round, roll dice based on the number of players, group them by number, then place them on an action space of the circular action wheel, starting with the current position of the farmer; the farmer moves each round, which means that dice showing 1s, 2s, etc. will end up on different spaces each round. Once the dice have been placed, each player drafts one die and uses it as described below. Once everyone has drafted a die, all players get to use the lowest-valued die remaining on the action wheel. A die lets you do two things, which you can do in either order:<br\/><br\/><br\/>     Plant or water the numbered zone matching the value of the die.<br\/>     Take the action of the space from which you removed the die.<br\/><br\/><br\/>To plant, you mark the bottom space of two empty crop tracks. (Note that you can't plant beans until the corn adjacent to the beans is tall enough to support them.) To water, you mark one space in all the crop tracks that already have at least one mark in them. As for the actions on the action wheel, you can:<br\/><br\/><br\/>     Plant or water again in the same numbered zone.<br\/>     Gain one compost (which lets you adjust die values) and four goods (which will get you bonuses at the farmer's market).<br\/>     Mark off the hive track, which can bring you points, goods, or bonus actions.<br\/>     Mark one of the four fruit tracks. Each fruit is worth different points and different amounts of goods and has different track lengths and circle positions.<br\/>     Visit the farmer's market, which gives you points and bonuses based on the number of goods you've collected.<br\/>     Mark one of the fifteen tool tracks in your shed. As soon as you complete a track, you gain that power or end-game scoring opportunity.<br\/><br\/><br\/>Perennials don't have a direct action associated with them and are marked off only through actions in other areas, with the various perennials giving different bonuses as you mark them.<br\/><br\/>At the end of the round, all players receive a bonus action, either rain that waters all numbered zones in your garden, a trip to the shed, or a visit to the farmer's market. After eight rounds, you score points for harvested crops, perennials, the apiary, fruit, and some shed items.
