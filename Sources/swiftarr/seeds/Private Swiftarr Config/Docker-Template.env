# This is a template for making Swiftarr config files in Docker. The values in this file get set as environment vars
# (with setenv()) during Swiftarr app startup and are referenced in the Docker-Compose files and/or scripts.
# If you haven't yet, you should make copies of this file, named `development.env` and `production.env`, and set up
# passwords for the databases and admin users.
#
# Swiftarr's git repo is set up so that any new files in `/Sources/swiftarr/seeds/Private Swiftarr Config` are ignored.
# The .env files with sensitive passwords in them should not get checked in.
#
# "In general" we recommend using this file as a template for stack/containerized deployments and production environments.

# Environment
#
# ENVIRONMENT: String of the environment name. Usually "development" or "production".
#              Should match the name of this file.

# DATABASE_TIMEOUT: Seconds for a database transaction to take before being considered dead.
