/// Prune Old Event Forums

/// In long-lived Swiftarr instances such as the Beta, we typically do not reset
/// the database between sailings. As we accumulate years of events, the amount
/// of forums starts to grow unweildy. The old events are marked as deleted and
/// removed from the schedule, but the forums remain. This backend command is
/// intended to be executed by an operator in one of these long-lived environments
/// to soft-delete all forums that are linked to soft-deleted events.
///
/// The effects of this command can be reversed by importing the deleted schedule
/// again which will restore the events and their associated forums (thanks,
/// soft-delete).
