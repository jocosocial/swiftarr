        "gameDescription": "4 the Birds is the board game in which you will use beak-and-taloned strategy as well as a peck of luck to be the first to &quot;flock&quot; four of your birds together in a tree besieged by a menagerie of other birds trying to do the same. By constantly balancing the goal of flocking your own birds and &quot;Flock-Blocking&quot; opponents' birds, a see-saw battle for avian supremacy ensues &mdash; and beware the non-player bird-baddies (crows and hawks) that can swoop in to un-nest a would-be winner.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple. Each player rolls two dice on their turn to indicating coordinates on the game board grid (the tree) to place and move your six birds on the board. Each turn a player has the choice to place a bird at the rolled coordinate or play one of seven Action Cards as they work to achieve the winning formation of a four bird flock (either a square or straight line on the grid).<br/><br/><br/>    Fast and easy to learn and play <br/>    Finely balanced mix of luck and strategy <br/>    Territorial disputes between birds is resolved via novel &quot;Pecking Order&quot; <br/>    Introduces a unique slide mechanic when birds vie for the same spot on the boards <br/>    Non-player spoiler-birds (crows and hawks) add unique obstacles as well as chain-reaction board-reorganizing sliding and scattering <br/>    Truly an abstract &quot;gateway&quot; game that's great for kids' spatial and numerical skills (and even better for adults who are out of practice)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.<br/><br/>What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.<br/><br/>Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.<br/><br/>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.<br/><br/>A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

It's now 1819, and a sinister darkness descends upon the city of Paris. A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, claiming to possess the late Frankenstein's research. He sponsors a grand competition, offering an even grander prize: unlocking the mystery of mortality!<br/><br/>Renowned scientists from around the world come to take part: some drawn to solve this eternal riddle, others coerced against their will. But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the secretive patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow.<br/><br/>Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a competitive game of strategic monster building for 2-4 players, inspired by Mary Shelley's classic novel of gothic horror. In the game, the creature demands your help to accomplish what his own creator would not: to bring to life an abomination like itself, a companion to end its miserable solitude. Through worker placement and careful management of decomposing resources, you'll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab &mdash; all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a &quot;spark of being&quot;. Do well, and the creature may reward you during one of its surprise visits; do poorly, and you may come to regret not putting forth more effort. Narrative elements come into play throughout the game, guided by your decisions, leading to potentially unsavory outcomes.<br/><br/>The game ends when you succeed in bringing your creation to life or when the Captain kills the creature, whichever happens first. Then the player with the most points fulfills Frankenstein's dark legacy, becoming his heir, for good or ill...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn. Certain compatible robots can combine into greater forms, too!

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.<br/><br/>Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.<br/><br/>The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.<br/><br/>In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.<br/><br/>Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Dance with Dragons (2012)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 A Feast for Crows (2013)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) \u2013 Mother of Dragons (2018)<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>     A Game of Thrones (2003)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)<br/>     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "The Brothers of the Night's Watch seek a new leader from among their ranks. Jeor Mormont wishes to promote one who can improve the infrastructure of the Gift, the bountiful and undeveloped area south of the Wall bestowed to the Watch by the Starks thousands of years ago. Drawing sustenance from the unforgiving landscape of the north offers enough challenges, but whomever takes up this task must also man and defend the Wall against the onslaught of Wildlings fighting their way into Westeros. Many brothers now compete to build, defend, and do what they can to protect Westeros, but only one shall rise above their brothers to become the new Lord Commander. But be wary &mdash; the north holds many dangers, and winter is coming.<br/><br/>A Game of Thrones Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch is based on the classic Settlers of Catan base game. In this game, each area in the Gift supplies one of five resources: lumber, brick, wool, grain, and ore. The barren Ice Fields, however, produce nothing. Players take on the role of Brothers of the Night's Watch and use these resources to strengthen their hold on the north by building roads, settlements, and keeps; recruiting guards for their patrol; or buying development cards. Each of these acts bring players increased power and recognition through the awarding of victory points. The objective will be familiar to players of the original Catan; the first player to achieve ten victory points wins the game and becomes the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<br/><br/>But this is not as easy as it sounds as the area surrounding the Gift can be treacherous. Wildings from north of the Wall have crossed over and follow their own rules of honor, which often conflict with the laws of Westeros. One of their ranks, Tormund Giantsbane, does not respect the Watch's claim to the land as he moves throughout the Gift, robbing resources from the Brothers sent to provide for their Order. While Tormund runs amok south of the Wall, Wildling forces gather in the Frostfangs, awaiting an opportune moment of weakness to breach the Watch's defenses and spread throughout the fruitful lands of Westeros. In addition to building within the Gift, players must strategically balance their resources to defend the Realm from Wildling raiders.<br/><br/>Each player may recruit up to seven brothers from the prisons of Westeros to don their specific color and man their section of the Wall. When the Wildings attack, each player must use their guards to fend off the onslaught. If there are more guards than Wildings, the Wall stands. If there are not, the Wildings invade the Gift and pillage the settlements and keeps therein. Yet loyalty only goes so far &mdash; guards are useless defending the Wall from Climbers who slip past them, and if they encounter a Giant, at least one guard is bound to desert his post.<br/><br/>Each player also has a hero to aide in their toil, based on the order of play. The first player will utilize the talents of the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont, while the second player will enjoy the company of Samwell Tarly, the third will work with Bowen Marsh, and the fourth will employ the services of Master Builder Othell Yarwyck. Each hero offers a unique ability to each player which they can use up to twice during the game. Once a hero's ability has been used, players have a choice to keep that hero or choose another of the eleven heroes to aide them. Players should factor the heroes' abilities into their strategy to quickly earn victory points and gain renown within the Watch.<br/><br/>The Wildling invasion marks the truest test of the Brothers of the Watch and your own competency as a commander. A failure at the Wall has a devastating impact on the Gift, even if it does not destroy the players. A Game of Throne Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch has two forms of victory, though one may feel hollower than the other. Victory occurs when a player has both improved the infrastructure of the Gift and successfully kept it safe from invaders. This is shown when a player has achieved ten victory points by any combination of building keeps, roads, and settlements; hiring three or more guards to keep the Wall safe; and buying development cards to increase their prestige, all while safeguarding the Gift.<br/><br/>However, if the Wildlings breach the wall three times throughout the game, an alternate victory takes place. If this occurs, the game ends immediately as the Brotherhood of the Night's Watch can no longer delay their decision. The player commanding the most guards holding their posts on the Wall gains the title of Lord Commander and wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.<br/><br/>In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.<br/><br/>The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.<br/><br/>Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)<br/><br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, you mark your arrival by the placement of your first access point. Then, each turn, you get to take a single action: establish another access point, execute a program, or pass. Your goal is to use the programs at your disposal to secure your access points so that they control as many of Titan's vulnerable accounts as possible.<br/><br/>Most of the generic programs write pathways between Titan's various nodes, allowing you to place a blue partition between the nodes on the board. Whenever your partitions seal off a section of the board containing only your access point or access points, they are &quot;secured&quot; and flipped face down. They are no longer vulnerable to your opponents' programs, and you will score the accounts they control at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Android: Mainframe differs from its predecessor Bauhaus in a number of ways, such as each player having a hand of cards and the game including six runners who each have five distinctive programs.<br/><br/>",

If a match occurs, the two matching players face-off and must quickly give an example of something within the category (eg. breakfast food, lake, reptile) listed on the opposing player's card.  The first person to finish saying a correct answer wins the face-off and takes the opponent's card into a face down &quot;winnings&quot; pile.  Since cards are played on top of each other, the player who lost the face-off reveals an earlier card on their stack and may immediately match another player's card causing a cascade of face-offs.<br/><br/>In addition there are wildcards which allow different symbols to match until it is overwritten by another wildcard which may then trigger a whole new set of face-offs.

As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices, and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times, and rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?<br/><br/>The aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing various buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's cathedral. Throughout the game, players need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace. But however much the people of Dunwich may distrust outsiders, they desperately need your help against the Horror that has manifested on the Whateley farm...<br/><br/>Dunwich Horror adds 8 new Investigators, 4 new Ancient Ones and many new Investigator cards, Mythos cards and monsters to the base set.  It also adds new location cards, for a total of 14 cards at each location instead of 7. Dunwich Horror also adds many new mechanics. Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game. Players reduced to 0 stamina or sanity have the option of drawing from the Injury or Madness deck, acquiring permanent handicaps, rather than losing half their items and clue tokens. Gates are no longer permanently sealed (a popular house rule in the base game). Condition cards provide benefits to all players may be activated. And, of course, the Dunwich Horror itself - not as strong as the Ancient Ones, yet far stronger than any other monster in the game.<br/><br/>This expansion also features revised rules and an FAQ that addresses many of the perceived faults of the base game.

The police chief is going to give all of you, the aspiring beat cops, a couple of murder investigations to see who has what it takes to become a real detective.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: All of you absolutely do not have what it takes.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean you aren't going to give it your best. You've watched, like, a whole marathon of police TV shows last weekend and you think you've got the formula for justice all figured out. And if there's one thing you've learned about the criminal justice system, it's this: It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong, it just matters how good you can look in front of your boss.<br/><br/>Bad Detectives is a tile-based card game for 3-4 players, which takes approximately 45-60 minutes to play. Players take turns adding information to a network of Polaroid photos and strings, creating a map of the murder investigation. The players will use these strings to connect a Suspect, Weapon, and Crime Scene to the Victim. Once completed, the case is ready to go to trial.<br/><br/>However, solving the murder investigation is simply a means to an end. The true objective of the game is to be the detective with the most Evidence Points when the central case goes to trial. When a player adds a new card to the investigation, Evidence Points are put into play on the card as it is placed. However, these are only counted towards a player's final score if those cards are used to directly link the Victim to the most relevant Leads. To succeed, players will need to undermine the credibility of their colleagues, take creative shortcuts to justice, and put their contributions to the case in the places that matter most.<br/><br/>",

When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. The object of the game is to be the first to complete a word grid after the &quot;bunch&quot; of tiles has been depleted.<br/><br/>There are variants included in the instructions, such as Banana Smoothie and Banana cafe for limited set skills or space-deprived places, and the game is suitable for solo play.<br/><br/>",

Of course, there is not just &quot;one bear;&quot; on the contrary, there are plenty of subspecies that differ from each other in various aspects. For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs. The polar bear (ursus maritimus) weighs &quot;only&quot; 1,100 lbs., but gets much bigger than the Kodiak bear, being as much as 11 ft. tall!<br/><br/>B&auml;renpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park. Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house? The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat! Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely! (* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)<br/><br/>In more detail, each player in B&auml;renpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible. The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more. The sooner you build it, the better! Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.<br/><br/>During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.<br/><br/>The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances.

Actions include drawing an art supplies cards, discarding two matching cards to claim the matching technique card (which is worth 2 points and 1 bonus point when used), sweep the art supplies card row, place a paint on their palette, wash half their palette, or complete a section of a painting. To take this latter action, the player needs to have all of the paint needed for one of the painting's three sections on their palette with no unneeded colors mixed in! The player scores points equal to the number of paints used, bonus points if they're the first or second to paint this, and additional points if they've painted this feature before Bob (i.e., did you paint this before the Bob figure reaches this space on the painting track.<br/><br/>When someone has completed all three features on a painting or Bob has reached the end of the painting track, this work is complete! Remove it from the easel, and start a new painting. Players continue to take turns until someone reaches a maximum chill of 30 points, at which point they win the game instantly.<br/><br/>",

Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.<br/><br/>Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game, a world based on the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft and his literary circle. In this world, conflicts rage between cosmic powers who want the world for their own unfathomable purposes and the human agencies dedicated to stopping them.<br/><br/>The weird world of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos has drawn in fans for more than eighty years, with its richly painted themes of suspense, adventure, and the eerie unknown. Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game is fully immersed in this world and what is more, places you, as a player, in control of some of the facets of that world.<br/><br/>A typical game of Call of Cthulhu plays very quickly between two players and it has a high-level of player interaction, analysis of open information, planning and strategy. There is a wide variety of possible combinations of factions (Syndicate with Agency, Cthulhu with Hastur, etc.) and each combination will necessitate a different, challenging approach, providing high levels of re-playability.<br/><br/>One of the major appeals of the Living Card Game&reg; format is that it gives you not only a solid game experience, full of strategy and excitement, but it also allows you to customize your gaming experience to your liking. As you customize your deck from the Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game card pool, you get to build a strategy around your personal play style.<br/><br/>This game was originally a CCG, having been transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Monthly Asylum Pack expansions to the card pool were eventually supplanted by larger quarterly(-ish) expansion boxes.<br/><br/>FFG ended development and organized play support for the game in 2015. &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons, even death may die.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>First game in the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.<br/><br/>It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:<br/>- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles.<br/>- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.<br/>- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.<br/>- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.<br/><br/>The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion<br/><br/>In the 2020 edition <br/>- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now.<br/>- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows. <br/>- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end. Fishing huts likewise.<br/>- Players each get 3 huts instead of just 2.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include basic and advanced versions.<br/><br/>This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.  The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release.<br/><br/>UPC 4005556812431<br/><br/>",

When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.<br/><br/>Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.<br/><br/>",

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>The game changes the base game in three main ways:<br/><br/>First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.<br/><br/>Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)<br/><br/>Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "The Rivals for Catan is a reimplementation of Catan Card Game.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br/><br/>Ways to Play:<br/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Twenty years ago, the settlers started into the depths of the galaxy to discover unknown planets, the undiscovered universe lying before them. Maybe they'll find planets with good ore or carbon deposits &mdash; or perhaps only barren ice planets. They might encounter alien folks and start lucrative trading, with pirates and wormholes being a constant challenge for them.<br/><br/>Catan: Starfarers is a new version of Starfarers of Catan, originally released in 1999, that contains completely revised graphics and game materials, revised rules, and (most importantly) a variable game board that brings even more variety to the exploration of space.<br/><br/>Changes to the mechanics include<br/><br/>-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll. Two random cards initially, then one, then none as your victory points go up. This is a nice touch. No matter how unlucky you are you still get something. Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck.<br/><br/>- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards. Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e. three of one for one of any other type. Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1. This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.<br/><br/>- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type. But you have to get there early. Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own.<br/><br/>- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades. They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game. Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.<br/><br/>- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die. I think this actually works better.<br/><br/>Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system. This is the same as building towns in Catan. But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count. In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system. In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.  If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems. Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "In 2010, designer Klaus Teuber overhauled the two-player Catan card game with the release of The Rivals for Catan &ndash; released in Germany as Die F&uuml;rsten von Catan &ndash; and in 2011 Teuber, Kosmos and Mayfair Games present a new multi-player card game set in the Catan universe: The Struggle for Catan, aka, Die Siedler von Catan: Das schnelle Kartenspiel.<br/><br/>As in the original The Settlers of Catan board game, players need to manage their resources in order to build settlements, roads, cities, city improvements and knights, all of which grant victory points (VPs) or special abilities. Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.<br/><br/>(Note that Kosmos lists this game with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60 minutes.)<br/><br/>Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.<br/><br/>The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.<br/><br/>",

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.

        "gameDescription": "In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.<br/><br/>At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/>-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/>-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/>-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/>-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/>-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/>-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/>-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>",

During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally...the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again.<br/><br/>",

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.<br/><br/>The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square). With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players.<br/><br/>",

Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage.

You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:<br/><br/><br/>    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.<br/>    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.<br/>    Boots, which are used to move around the board.<br/><br/><br/>Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they&rsquo;ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player&rsquo;s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.<br/><br/>During the game, you have two goals:<br/><br/>    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.<br/>    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation. If correct, the player wins, but if incorrect, the player must return the cards to the file without revealing them and may no longer make suggestions or accusations. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/>Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players. Recent and current issues of the game state 3-6 players.<br/><br/>",

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?<br/><br/>In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.<br/>    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!<br/><br/><br/>The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.<br/><br/>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.<br/><br/>Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.<br/><br/>You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!<br/><br/>",

In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others &ndash; or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.<br/><br/>Although Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools, and even favors &ndash; if there is truly honor among chemists!<br/><br/>",

However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. <br/> As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.<br/><br/>The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Under a blazing sun in 4th century BCE, traders come from all corners of the Mediterranean Sea to Corinth to sell their goods; Persian carpets, Cretan olive oil, Roman grapes, and Egyptian spices are highly prized by traders. Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!<br/><br/>Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.<br/><br/>The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)<br/><br/>The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.<br/><br/>Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.<br/><br/>You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.<br/><br/>After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.<br/><br/>",

As they tell their story, they play a card, and if they can link multiple cards from their hand together, they receive a bonus of some sort usable later in the defeat of the Great Old One (or his ascension if the player turns out to be a cultist).  If something is mentioned and another player has a card matching what is mentioned, he takes over the story and uses his cards at that point.<br/><br/>The objective is to tell a great story and then reach the climactic fight between the investigators and the Great Old One which is told in story-format as well.<br/><br/>Cthulhu's Vault is co-designed by Richard Launius and Jim Dietz.

        "gameDescription": "&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a game series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!<br/><br/>Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.<br/><br/>Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.<br/><br/>",

Yes, they're all available, and if you're good enough &ndash; that is, if you progress up through the &quot;hack&quot; levels represented by the number on your character's die &ndash; you may even get to play that complicated character part &quot;Rear-end of Horse&quot;!<br/><br/>In Deadwood Studios USA (originally published as Deadwood), players wander across the backlot each day, looking for acting jobs. Your actor is a six-sided die, and the number on top represents your status. (These dice are never rolled; they just show your status.) After you take a role in the movie, you can roll a die and try to &quot;act&quot;, or you can &quot;rehearse&quot; to improve your odds. As you work, you'll earn money and fame, and you can trade those things at the casting office for higher status, which brings you the ability to take better-paying roles.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you add up your money, fame, and status points, and the player with the highest score is the best actor at Deadwood Studios!<br/><br/>",

Players control a party of heroes whose quests send them to far off lands facing monsters to protect innocent bystanders. They must band together to gain strength and defeat the evils that plagued the fair lands of Dievalice. After each encounter, players will have a chance to level up their classes and learn new skills, giving them more abilities and dice to use in the upcoming battles.<br/><br/>Players choose 1&ndash;2 heroes to control on a team of 3&ndash;4 heroes and gather a green die for each one, then add 4 attack cards per hero to make an attack deck. Following the setup on the quest card players would then reveal a monster card for each hero into the center. Players roll a pool of dice then assign one to an available attack slot on their hero card(s). Once all dice are assigned players reveal an attack card for each monster then resolve attacks from the lowest to the highest value of card or die. Enemies target the hero that has an assigned die that is equal to or greater than their attack card value. Heroes choose enemies to target and can use hero abilities at any point to gain an edge in battle. After all attacks the attack cards are discarded and heroes gather their dice again, roll and assign all over.<br/><br/>Defeated enemies add cards back into the attack deck; if the deck runs out, heroes start taking additional damage. Once all enemies are defeated, Heroes have the opportunity to buy items and choose the next quest that matches the symbol on their quest card. They also level up by either flipping over their hero card and either taking an ability from one of those cards or covering up the bottom with a new class card.<br/><br/>Together you will either win and defeat the boss or have your party get knocked out by the overwhelming peril. If you win the next time you play the choices you made before will affect the next generation of heroes. Relics that you previously found on quests get added to the item deck and the enemy attack cards that you added will stay and affect the next generation of heroes. The choices you make will continue the story.<br/><br/>",

Use the lower half of the cylindrical package as your Dice Cup. Grab a piece of paper and a pen for scoring (not included).<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>The object of the game is to use as many of the 28 Word Dice as possible in the three minutes allotted to form logically correct sentences. All sentences must intersect at one or more points.<br/>Correct: They desire her lips<br/>Incorrect: They lips her desire<br/>The player or team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/><br/>     Any number of consenting adults may play. Create two or more equal teams of players. If there are only two players, you can just play with yourself.<br/>     It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who goes first, so to start, the first team places all 28 Word Dice in the Dice Cup. The bottom half of the package is used as the Dice Cup. Shake the Dice Cup thoroughly, and roll all the Word Dice onto the playing surface.<br/>     Invert the timer immediately and begin forming sentences with words on the top side of the Word Dice. Play stops when the timer runs out (after approximately three minutes). IMPORTANT! Any blank Dice rolled may be used as any word the<br/><br/><br/>players desire. It should be noted, however, that blank Dice have no point value when calculating the point total.<br/><br/>     Any noun may be made plural. Example: Man to Men or Woman to Women<br/>     Any verb may have an -S, -ING, -LY, or -ED added to suit the sense of the particular sentence it is used in. Example:<br/><br/><br/> I SPANK SHE SPANKS YOU ARE SPANKING WE SPANKED<br/> (Note: the ending of -PERY may also be added to the verb SLIP, making it the adjective SLIPPERY.)<br/><br/>     You may use any punctuation you like! This is one time where you don't need to panic if you have a missing period.<br/><br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>     Five points are scored for each Word Die used at the end of the three minutes.<br/>     Deduct three points for each Word Die not used.<br/>     Any Word Die used in two sentences is given a double value&ndash;<br/><br/><br/>10 points!<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME<br/>The suggested game length is three rounds...if you can last that long. The person or team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner, and presented with an M.D.W.

New borders are drawn, and expanded through strength of arms and subtle maneuver. Each duke seeks to establish a claim over the most valuable parts of the kingdom before the king finally returns. In the dark of the Middle Ages, control of the land was the key to wealth and power. Can you control enough territory to become the most prestigious duke before the king&rsquo;s return?<br/><br/>In Domaine, players form domaines by placing walls on the modular board to enclose territory. Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.<br/><br/>Actions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.<br/><br/>Players score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.<br/><br/>",

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.<br/><br/>Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!<br/><br/>In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.<br/><br/>Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.  It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.<br/><br/>",

Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash.

Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.<br/><br/>Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One.

A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring. Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?<br/><br/>Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.<br/><br/>While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.<br/><br/>Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.<br/><br/>All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.<br/><br/>With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.<br/><br/>",

Each cult is in competition to be first to summon their god, but they all must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to hasten doom...before it's too late!<br/><br/>During the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to do one of two things to aid their cult in their mission: Use the spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, or use the symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready a spell. Readied spells can be cast at any time, but while in a cult's Spell Reserve their primary Astral Symbol can aid in readying future spells, creating an engine for pumping out more potential power.<br/><br/>As cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As cults send more and more cultists to a location, they may gain control there, adding even more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful how they navigate Arkham as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, placing Elder Signs, and generally getting in the way of summoning your Elder God. Gain too many Elder Signs and it's game over!<br/><br/>If any cult can manage to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, &quot;win&quot; is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world &mdash; but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.<br/><br/>",

You must protect your tower with all the resources at your disposal: dispatch fire engines to combat the blaze, order air drops of water, and plan the building of firebreaks. Competing fire departments will complicate your work, using the unrelenting winds to their advantage in an attempt to safeguard their own towers and threaten yours. The chaotic Firestorm also stalks the deck and will dramatically swell the flames each time it is drawn. Will you effectively use your forces to outwit your opponents and survive the inferno? Can you be the last tower standing?<br/><br/>Fire Tower is a competitive game where players must fight fire with fire. Most fire fighting games have a cooperative aspect with players working together to beat back the flames, but in Fire Tower your only objectives are to protect your own tower and spread the blaze towards your opponents. The game plays 2-4 players, ages 12+, and takes 15+ minutes. Action cards allow players to alter the direction of the wind, and add varying patterns of fire, water, and defensive barriers to the board. The skill comes in effectively directing the resources in your hand and using sound spatial planning to deploy them.<br/><br/>The game incorporates an intuitive play structure that takes minutes to learn and requires negligible set-up. Each card includes a grid that visually explains the ways it can be used,  saving new players from having to constantly refer to the rulebook. Although the core mechanics are easy to grasp, an ever shifting environment forces players to switch up their tactics and experiment with varied strategies, making Fire Tower a difficult game to master and each play through a fresh experience.<br/><br/>",

In this memory game, players flip tiles to find the ingredients to complete orders to collect money (more complex orders are more valuable) and tips.<br/><br/>The game is set up by dealing 25 tiles face-down in a 5x5 grid, and dealing 5 order cards face-up below the grid.<br/><br/>On your turn, you flip over 4 tiles from the grid. If the ingredients revealed match the ingredients required for one of the orders, you collect that order and the money along with it. If you reveal a tip tile along with the ingredients to complete a recipe, collect a tip card. The value of which you will keep secret until the end of the game. Each order card also includes a special ability which will be available for a one-time use on a future turn.<br/><br/>Tiles used to complete orders are discarded and replaced from the tile deck and completed order cards are replaced with new orders from the order deck.<br/><br/>The game ends after a player has successfully completed 5 orders. Players finish out that round, so each player has had an equal number of turns, and the player with the highest combined dollar amount from completed orders and collected tips wins!<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.<br/><br/>What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.<br/><br/>With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.<br/> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!<br/><br/>",

Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.<br/><br/>The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.<br/><br/>To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.<br/><br/>To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.<br/><br/>There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.<br/><br/>",

Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie&rsquo;s patronage. Who will be top ghost?<br/><br/>The game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day Phase and a Night Phase.<br/><br/>During the day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the night and survived will calm down from their twilight visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next night by buying more Terror Dice, Scare Tactics to improve their scaring and Spookie favours to give those extra little bonuses.<br/><br/>During the night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their creepy tactics to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.<br/><br/>",

But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life.

The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.<br/><br/>Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br/><br/>This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat.<br/><br/>",

In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.<br/><br/>Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br/><br/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.<br/><br/>To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.<br/><br/>After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition'). The game has three expansions, namely<br/><br/>    Dagger Isle<br/>    Drifter's Nexus<br/>    Necropolis Park<br/><br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.<br/><br/>There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.<br/>The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.<br/><br/>A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.<br/><br/>When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card. Being set in Ankh-Morpork, many other random hazards face players, but we don't want to spoil the surprise and tell you everything! Where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>",

While the Haven Guardian slumbers, a nearby human village has grown into a city, hungry to control the powers of the forest. Can the forest creatures discover enough potent lore to defend their ancient home from the oppressive city &mdash; or will the city use this lore to power their machines and turn the forest against itself?<br/><br/>The battle for Haven begins!<br/><br/>In Haven, you and your opponent battle for control of a mystical forest. The Haven Guardian, spirit of the forest, sleeps deeply and can no longer protect its kingdom. One of you controls the city in an effort to master the vulnerable forest using &quot;stone lore&quot; and machines. The other plays as the forest and its creatures who defend their home with the aid of &quot;leaf lore&quot; and forest spirits.<br/><br/>To obtain the power needed to oppose your enemy, you must send seekers to compete for the lore controlled by elementals, ancient beings who bestow the lore on those who seek it. Seekers also engage in combat for control of shrines on the board, scoring you bonus points if you occupy a majority of shrines surrounding forest havens. When one type of lore is depleted or one elemental has left the board, the Haven Guardian awakens and the player with the higher score masters the forest &mdash; or defends it from harm &mdash; and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The only hope for these helpless villagers is that the Apothecary Healers, their god-like saviors, will save them. Led by ancient warriors Penicillin, Cipro, and Tetracycline, the Apothecary Healers rush into battle, destroying wave after wave of attacker just in the knick of time. Yet it&rsquo;s not that simple: the Apothecary Healers have different specialties, and must be deployed in a sophisticated manner. And worse: the invaders learn quickly how to resist and evade the Apothecary powers, and some become even stronger when they are struck down.<br/><br/>Healing Blade: Defenders of Soma&nbsp;immerses you in a fantasy realm that represents the real world struggle against infectious disease and bacterial resistance. It&rsquo;s a two player card game wherein one player attacks with bacteria, and the other defends with antibiotics.

Designed in a collaboration between hardcore gamers and practicing physicians, Defenders of Soma offers a complex strategic gameplay experience, while also increasing familiarity with today&rsquo;s medical quandries in the face of waning antibiotic effectiveness.<br/><br/>",

An 80-card Market deck is shared by all players, with five cards being revealed from that deck to create the Market Row. As you play, you use gold to buy champion cards and action cards from the Market. These champions and actions can generate large amounts of gold, combat, or other powerful effects. You use combat to attack your opponent and their champions. When you reduce your opponent's score (called health) to zero, you win!<br/><br/>Multiple expansions are available for Hero Realms that allow players to start as a particular character (Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard) and fight cooperatively against a Boss, fight Boss decks against one another, or compete in a campaign mode that has you gain experience to work through different levels of missions.<br/><br/>",

However, among your crew are machines and cyborgs disguised as humans with their own goals in mind. Achieve your goal of repairing or destroying the space-time continuum before fuel runs out!<br/><br/>-Story-<br/><br/>Immediately following humans' discovery of time travel, the space-time continuum began to fall apart along with the rest of civilization. You are all aboard the last time machine, but you are a mixed crew. Most of you are humans, set on repairing the damage your meddling has caused. However, two other races have disguised themselves as humans to sneak aboard your ship to accomplish their own sinister goals. The machines from the horrific future are bent on chaos to preserve their existence. The cyborgs from the near future, half-human half-machine, play both sides of order and chaos to achieve their own goals.<br/><br/>Since the time machine was invented by humans, it is unsurprisingly experiencing technical difficulties- notably the main controls. Landing in one of six eras, the crew needs to democratically decide which members are best equipped to repair spacetime by returning beings to their appropriate eras, or create a chain reaction of paradoxes to sow more chaos through time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.<br/><br/>In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...<br/><br/>In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:<br/><br/><br/>    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.<br/>    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.<br/>    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.<br/>    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.<br/>    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.<br/><br/><br/>When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "A tower building game.<br/><br/>Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br/><br/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br/><br/>According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Launch your junk ... uh, *cargo* ... out of your airlock to propel your ship! Race to deliver your cargo as you navigate the orbits of nearby planets and moons! It's astrodynamics for fun and profit! On your turn, carry out these three steps:<br/><br/>1. Launch junk &mdash; Choose any one junk tile in your cargo hold and move it away from your ship (clockwise or counter-clockwise, your choice) a number of spaces equal to its numeric value. If it reaches its destination city this way, you have made a remote delivery. Otherwise, it simply comes to rest after moving its full distance. It is also possible to hit an enemy ship with launched junk, causing that opponent to discard one junk tile from their cargo.<br/><br/>2. Move ship &mdash; Your ship must now move the same distance that your launched junk did, but in the opposite direction. When your ship reaches a transfer point between location boards, you may choose to switch orbits. If you do, your ship changes direction (from clockwise to counter-clockwise, or vice versa) as it enters the new orbit. If the space your ship lands on is the destination of any junk in your cargo, you have made a direct delivery.<br/><br/>3. Pick up junk &mdash; After moving your ship, pick up all junk tiles present in your current city, adding them to your cargo hold. Then, refill your current city with one new junk tile from the corresponding stack (e.g., if at a Mars city, refill from the Mars stack).<br/><br/>Each player has their own ship with a unique ship power that breaks the rules above in some way. The end of the game is triggered when a city cannot be refilled because its stack is empty. When this happens, every player gets one final turn, then players tally the values from all of their delivered junk tiles, and whoever has the highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

Some Evolutions are temporary, allowing a one-time bonus, while others are Permanent, such as Gigazaur's &quot;Tail Sweep&quot;, which allows him to change one die to a 1 or 2 each turn. Each Evolution card also identifies whether a monster is a Mutant, Invader, or Robot, and while not relevant for Power Up!, this species identification could come into play in future expansions.<br/><br/>The rules for King of Tokyo: Power Up! contain a few variants: Players start with a random Evolution in play, or draw two cards and choose the one they want, or draft a set of Evolutions prior to the start of play.

For years now, warlords have roamed the land, every surface is covered with filth, and disease has ripped through towns like great tornadoes. King Sivolc has dreamed that building a great gothic structure is the answer to leave this Dark Age behind forever. But for the last decade, there has been a massive decline in the building activity, and hardly any great cultural achievements have been made.<br/><br/>Recently, while on one of his crusades, King Sivolc met a master architect named Elias. Elias told the King about his devotion to the mortar arts and how he longed to build a structure so great that people would travel hundreds of miles just to gaze at it. This meeting created a spark that ignited the King&rsquo;s dream with a fire that would burn away even the darkest of days forever. King Sivolc looks on from his castle and watches with great expectation as his dream becomes a reality.  With Elias&rsquo; help, he has hired some of the greatest architects and monks in the land to complete this task. He waits patiently for this great abbey to be raised from the earth, filled with people, changing the course of history forever!<br/><br/>The King's Abbey is a worker placement/resource management game in which each player has their own player board that represents the abbey they have been tasked to build. Players take charge of monks that are represented by ten dice as they go out and gather resources, go on crusades, construct buildings, train clergy, bring in peasants, and defend their abbey against the darkness. Each player does this by rolling their dice and then assigning each die (monk) to different places on their player board, resource boards, and crusade cards. The places on the player boards will bring in peasants and train clergy. The places on the resource boards will give them wood, grain, stone, and sand for building the various parts of their individual abbeys.<br/><br/>Each player receives prestige (victory points) for completing crusades and constructing various things in their abbey such as towers and different kinds of buildings. The game proceeds over a total of seven rounds where the &quot;darkness&quot; becomes greater each round. The darkness represents things like depression, famine, raiders attacking, and other things that the Dark Ages brought with it. You fight the darkness by keeping the defenses of your abbey strong. Players are trying to have the most prestige than any other player by the end of the seventh round.<br/><br/>After seven rounds, players add up all prestige earned. Whoever has the most prestige wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.<br/><br/>The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.<br/><br/>Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:<br/><br/>1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.<br/><br/>2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game<br/><br/>3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Lazer Ryderz is a trackless racing game for up to 4 players with light push-your-luck, area denial, and strategy elements. Players construct their lazer paths with various pre-formed punchboard pieces that are placed according to speed and desired direction.<br/><br/>In Lazer Ryderz, players take on the role of one of four Ryderz as they race to capture all three Prisms needed to charge the Portal to their next destination. The Portal only allows one Ryder to pass through before moving on to a new location in the galaxy, so speed is essential to meet your goal. But the faster a Ryder goes the harder it is to turn, and if a Ryder runs into another player's lazer, that Ryder is toast! Who will continue on their quest and who will be left behind?<br/><br/>Will it be the Galactic Waveryder - the adrenaline-fueled surfer who's seeking the next great thrill and most radical solar waves? Or the Lazer Shark  - always on the hunt for her next prey as she seeks the fabled Blood Nebula to restart her species? Perhaps the Super Sheriff - greatest of the Law Star Rangers who travels to the outer reaches of the known (and unknown) galaxy to bring the universe's criminals to speedy justice? Or will it be the Phantom Cosmonaut - the ghost from a long-distant era whose true quest is a mystery to those he encounters, but with speed that is without question as he moves in the blink of an eye?<br/><br/>",

As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.<br/><br/>After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that it&rsquo;s only visible to other players and not to you.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word. The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players&rsquo; letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.<br/><br/>The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.<br/><br/>Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their common success.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines. During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets. Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "You and your opponents represent powerful developers in a burgeoning Nevada city. You will earn money and prestige by building the biggest and most profitable casinos on &quot;The Strip,&quot; the town's backbone of dust and sin. You start with nothing but parking lots and dreams, but from there you build, sprawl, reorganize and gamble your way to victory. Score the most points investing in the most profitable development companies and putting the best bosses in control of the richest casinos. Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!<br/><br/>The game board is broken into 6 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and points. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. Points go only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money. Ultimately, though, only points matter, and that means making yourself boss of the biggest casinos.<br/><br/>Lords of Vegas contains: <br/><br/>    Snazzy game board <br/>    4 turn summaries <br/>    55 cards <br/>    40 chips in 4 colors <br/>    48 dice in 4 colors <br/>    4 poker chips <br/>    Lots of money <br/>    45 casino blocks <br/>    Rules <br/><br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.<br/><br/>Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.<br/><br/>Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.<br/><br/>Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.<br/><br/>",

Pool your team's resources together to seek out the master word!<br/><br/>Master Word is a co-operative word-based deduction game in which players have to work together to try to find a secret word from a single starting hint.<br/><br/>Each game, a guide selects a card, looks at the master word, then shows the other players (seekers) the starting hint. The seekers then have 90 seconds to discuss and each write a clue on a card, which they place in a row. Once this is done, the guide places a number of tokens at the end of the row equal to the number of clues that are &quot;on the right track&quot; toward the master word. The only catch: The seekers don't know which clues the tokens refer to!<br/><br/>If the seekers write the master word on a solution card before the end of seven rounds, everyone wins! If they fail to do this or if they accidentally write the master word on a clue card, everyone loses!<br/><br/>",

Pterodactyls soar through the aviary, dinosaur eggs hatch in the nursery, and underwater creatures swim through the bright blue waters of the aquarium. Your zoo can include any or all of these attractions! To keep things running smoothly, attractions need to be regularly maintained. In order to score attractions in your zoo, you must keep a maintenance truck next to the attraction.<br/><br/>While visiting your zoo, guests will need to get around. Hopping on the monorail will quickly transport your guests to other corners of the park. In order to be effective, the monorail&rsquo;s route must be connected.

        "gameDescription": "Munchkin Apocalypse is a core set in the Munchkin series with an end of the world theme that includes natural disasters, zombie takeovers, Armageddon, alien invasions, nuclear war, etc. And while this is still a standard Munchkin game where you try to level up by killing the monsters, stealing the treasure, and stabbing your buddy, there's a new &quot;Seal&quot; mechanic that significantly changes the gameplay.<br/><br/>Seals are a reference to the biblical seals of the Apocalypse. They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.<br/><br/>The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.<br/><br/>Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;.

Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.<br/><br/>Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.<br/><br/>In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.<br/><br/>Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.<br/><br/>After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.<br/><br/>If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.<br/><br/>Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.<br/><br/>If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...<br/><br/>",

And eternal damnation awaits anyone foolish enough to uncover the three cursed relics of Garuda!<br/><br/>MOVE QUICKLY... CHOOSE WISELY! A treasure race packed with tough choices, twists &amp; turns!<br/><br/>In this 2-players game, each player moves around their own temple, which has spaces for room tiles and hiding places for 9 sacred and cursed relics around. These relics are placed randomly, face-down, around the temples and worth victory points once flipped face-up.<br/><br/>The first player to score 25 victory points wins the game. However, a player loses if they reveal all three cursed relics! Each round, the players compete to win a new room tile by using cards allowing them to throw fate sticks. The player with the most fate points showing on their sticks wins the room tile and places it in their temple. Each player attempts to create paths leading to their relics, enabling them to flip them face up and score victory points. Yet, Naga symbols on some sticks let you activate cards with powerful effects, so that you can never take anything for granted.<br/><br/>A GAMEPLAY WITH DUAL-USE CARDS AND STICKS<br/><br/>Players must decide how to use the cards in their hands: for throwing sticks or activating their effects?

You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must swap one of their cards (following that card's rule) with another player's card, then someone records that move on a chart. Blanks are considered to be 0 and an even number for the purpose of swaps. When one of your cards is swapped, you can look at the rule on the card you receive. You can suggest moves to others or ask questions of them, and they can respond with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers as long as they don't identify the rule on any of their cards.<br/><br/>If you place all the numbers in numerical order (disregarding blanks) in either clockwise or counterclockwise order before you would need to make a 25th move, you all win the game. Your team's score is &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Horrible&quot;, etc. based on how many moves it took you to win. If you don't win, then you must all be worse than horrible, which is very bad indeed.<br/><br/>In the game's expert mode, you cannot speak at all and you cannot undo a player's swap on your next turn.<br/><br/>",

And don't forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.<br/><br/>In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.<br/><br/>Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.<br/><br/>You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).<br/><br/>Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.<br/><br/>1. Get tattooed:<br/>This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.<br/><br/><br/>    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.<br/><br/><br/>2. Open play:<br/>This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.<br/><br/>3. Is a require discard.<br/>This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.<br/><br/>4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).<br/><br/>The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner. So just because you finished first, it doesn't mean you've won.<br/><br/>",

Renowned for their restorative properties, the noctiluca are desired by many healers. Only the most skilled divers can navigate the waters to collect these mysterious glowing creatures and deliver them to healers across the land. Can you catch the embers of the sea?<br/><br/>In Noctiluca, 104 colorful translucent dice fill the pool on the game board to represent the different glowing noctiluca. Players take turns diving into the water from the edges of the shore to collect the noctiluca dice from the board and keep them safely in jars until they can deliver them to healers. After two rounds, players compare points from their successful deliveries and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Thanks to a double-sided game board, Noctiluca also includes a solo mode in which one player must rescue the noctiluca from the tempest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a Viking clan, looking to achieve victory by reaping glory in various ways or controlling the most prized territories of this new continent.<br/><br/>The game focus is on streamlined rules and mechanisms, allowing for a fast-paced and smooth rhythm of play. Each turn, players alternate their actions to adapt their strategies to their opponents' moves and the expansion of the board. Fame (i.e., points) can be earned by exploring, fighting, and controlling and developing territories. The various corresponding actions are played through the cards that the players have in hand. At the end of each turn, they have to choose a new card to improve their personal deck as their clans develop new tactics and technologies.<br/><br/>The conquest of Northgard also requires clever management of resources to build new buildings, improve your warriors' effectiveness, better your hand of cards, and upgrade your clan's specificities. The winter phase makes this management more difficult as you have to feed your units to keep them healthy and happy.<br/><br/>The pace of the game is set by the players as the game ends after seven turns, but can also be cut short at any time if one of them is in control of three closed territories hosting certain types of buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough.

However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done.

There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player. On a player's turn, she chooses one of her cards, moves one of her pieces according to the chosen card, then replaces the card she used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of his cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card &mdash; which is, of course, the card the first player just used.<br/><br/>Moving onto one of the opponent's pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent's main pawn, or moving your main pawn into your opponent's main pawn's starting space, wins you the game.<br/><br/>",

Utilizing lands lost in the aether, players accumulate worshippers to spend on even more fruitful lands &mdash; some of which grant game-changing bonuses. The key to victory lies in having the most creation points (CPs) at the end of the game!<br/><br/>On your turn, you must take a tile from either the nine region tiles in the center of the table or the available God tiles. (A player may take only one God tile throughout the game.) Every time you take a region tile, worshippers of the same color as the tile taken are placed on adjacent tiles, making the tiles left behind more enticing for the next player. Restrictions apply to region tile placement, making each decision tougher than the last!<br/><br/>After fifteen rounds, the game ends when all players have created their universe, at which point CPs are calculated, bonus tiles awarded, and a winner is crowned. Beautifully simple yet rich in strategy, Orbis is a different game each and every time you play it.<br/><br/>Become the best god and craft your most prosperous universe!<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.<br/><br/>Whoever has the lowest card is the first active player. She decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; &mdash; that is, be dealt another card &mdash; or forfeit the round. If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.<br/><br/>If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)<br/><br/>There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games.

A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.<br/><br/>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!<br/><br/>The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.<br/><br/>Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.<br/><br/>Combining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome. A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns. As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle.<br/><br/>Simply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples. Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes. In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders.<br/><br/>Take on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team's chances to protect against the invaders. Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!<br/><br/>Pandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes. Players who want a more difficult game can try the &quot;Roma Caput Mundi&quot; challenge by adding more Revolt cards to the deck; they must also respect the law in Rome that Roman legions are not allowed in the city.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br/><br/>In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.<br/><br/>What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.<br/><br/>Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)<br/><br/>When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.<br/><br/>One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.<br/><br/>Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

        "gameDescription": "Pirate Dice is an innovative, fast and funny little board game about pirate life. It is full of everyday events from usual pirate life: battles, horror gigantic krakens and old maps. In the game you choose the character to play. It's one of the famous pirate leaders. Each of them has his own ability to help you get rich quickly.<br/><br/>Turn begins with the player opens the top card in the event deck and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles. For example, when the card Trade Fleet comes to play all players may send the quantity of their ships they want to rob that trade ship. In case the raid was successful all players divide the loot among themselves. When the card of Royal Fleet is opened all ships of all players have to take part in this battle. But they also have two alternatives: 1) they may try to escape: 2) or they may buy off those royal ships. There are also places where players may renew their ships. Floating Tavern is such card. The current player rolls a die and adds received number to the modification indicated on the card. This sum indicates the quantity of pirates in the floating tavern. These pirates are the cheapest in the game. They cost just one coin per pirate.  After this the players start hidden auction to determine who will be the first in buying the pirates. For the hidden auction they use coins, it means who may buy more rum to the pirates. Most likely, not all players will be able to buy new pirates. The player who collects more victory points  represented with gold and ships becomes the winner.<br/><br/>",

(From playing the game demo at Origins 2010)<br/><br/>A pirate themed variant of Fluxx, this game is much like the original. Simply follow the rules that are currently in play. Start by drawing a card and playing a card, but even those can be changed. There's no way to win at the begining, but once a Goal card is played, you have to play the appropriate Keeper cards in front of you or play other cards to keep them away from everyone else, like Steal a Keeper or play a new goal card to replace the old one.<br/><br/>New to Fluxx are the Surprise cards which can be played at any time to cancel certain plays or steal a keeper as played.<br/><br/>",

Players are given a 5-card hand and take turns laying cards (pooping) but trying not to clog the toilet! If the toilet is clogged the player must pick up the entire poop stack and a new toilet is started. If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards. Some cards make players perform crazy acts on their turns.<br/><br/>POOP: The Game is an original card game created by kids and adults for kids and adults. Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes. Adults love it because POOP makes them act like kids.<br/><br/>EDUCATIONAL: Younger children get a healthy dose of basic math while playing POOP. Seriously! You'll see them adding up the POOP cards to make sure they don't clog the toilet!<br/><br/>INTERACTION: One of the funnest stages of UNO is remembering to say &quot;UNO&quot; when down to your last card. POOP takes this one step further giving players similar responsibilities throughout the entire game. If you forget and other players remind you then you have to draw another card (and take a drink if you're playing POOP as a drinking game. Speaking of...)<br/><br/>DRINKING GAME FOR ADULTS: After getting feedback from our successful (and critically acclaimed) ZOMBIE SHUFFLE campaign, we learned that many people loved that we included drinking rules. For this reason we've made POOP an even easier drinking game. Players take drinks if they draw a card or clog the toilet and everyone drinks if the toilet is flushed.<br/><br/>ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES: We've found at least 3 other exciting ways to play POOP using the same standard deck! You'll find the Alternate Rules PDF in the downloadable Trial Version of POOP but we are very interested in what you come up with when playing with friends and family. Experiment and send us your ideas! We'll credit you if we share it with the POOP community.<br/><br/>",

In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums... If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion.<br/><br/>",

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original Funkenschlag, designer Friedemann Friese will take you back in time and let you relive the early beginnings of mankind. True to the name of the German edition (a literal translation of which is &quot;Flying Sparks&quot;), it is time for Funkenschlag: Die ersten Funken, or &quot;The First Sparks&quot;.<br/><br/>The First Sparks transports the Funkenschlag mechanisms into the Stone Age. The order of phases during a game round, the player order, the technology cards: you know all these parts from &ldquo;Funkenschlag&rdquo;. But what is new? What is different?<br/><br/>The First Sparks is much faster and far more direct. You are immediately part of the action. Each turn, each decision is important. As a clan leader you decide on the well-being of your clan during the Stone Age. You need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge - to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire. With the help of these skills, you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas.<br/><br/>In a game of The First Sparks you are always confronted with many decisions: Which technology cards offer you the biggest advantages? When is the right time to spread your clan on the game board? Which hunting areas will grant the most food? Reaching new hunting areas or trying to secure parts of the game board for your own clan are important factors for your strategy. Empty spaces are cheaper for you to settle compared to spaces in which other clans are already settled. If you are the first to increase your clan size to 13 clan members, you win The First Sparks.<br/><br/>",

A Push occurs when an Escort arrives short of another piece (Princes can't Push); what happens is that the Escort's remaining steps are transferred to the pushed piece --which may be an opposing piece or your own Prince.  The pushed piece's move must be in a straight line, in the direction dictated by the collision.  When the straight line isn't possible, deflection occurs as indicated in the rules.

Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br/><br/>Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!<br/><br/>",

If the player answers it correctly, they keep the card. If they don't, it's discarded.<br/><br/>When you win your sixth card and are one card away from winning, you must say &quot;Rabbit Rabbit&quot; out loud. If you forget and another player notices and says it first, skip your next turn, giving everyone else a chance to catch up.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to play:<br/><br/>Team Play. If you're playing with four or more players, you can optionally split up into teams of equal size.<br/><br/>Host Mode. Playing with three or more, and have an odd number of players? Designate one player as the Trivia Host, who opts out of answering cards, and instead has card reading duties.<br/><br/>Scored Play. If you'd like a faster pace, the host can open up each question card to all players, and everyone who answers correctly each round gets a point. The first to reach seven points wins.<br/><br/>Solo Play. Playing by yourself? Read the cards, challenge yourself to answer them correctly, and see if you're right.<br/><br/>Important Note: Superstitions, like all folklore, can vary wildly and change over time, with multiple variations even in the same small region. If you find a superstition in Rabbit Rabbit described differently than one that you grew up with and hold close to your heart, you're strongly encouraged to share your version with everyone.

To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!<br/><br/>To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:<br/><br/><br/>     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.<br/><br/>",

There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.<br/><br/>",

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.<br/><br/>Root represents the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible.<br/><br/>The Cats play a game of engine building and logistics while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to produce workshops, lumber mills, and barracks. They win by building new buildings and crafts.<br/><br/>The Eyrie musters their hawks to take back the Woods. They must capture as much territory as possible and build roosts before they collapse back into squabbling.<br/><br/>The Alliance hides in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build towards a dramatic late-game presence--but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for their own gain, while hiding a mysterious quest. Explore the board, fight other factions, and work towards achieving your hidden goal.<br/><br/>In Root, players drive the narrative, and the differences between each role create an unparalleled level of interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.<br/><br/>The game mechanics in more detail<br/><br/>A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:<br/>Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.<br/>Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.<br/>Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.<br/>Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).<br/>Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.<br/>Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).<br/><br/>",

They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.<br/><br/>Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).<br/><br/>These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: <br/>- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) <br/>- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards<br/>- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals.

The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.<br/>In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.<br/><br/>The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler.

An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!<br/><br/>Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.<br/><br/>Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.<br/><br/>",

Varying card backs allow for vastly improved strategic planning - knowing what card type is coming up next allows you and your fellow Agents to make more informed decisions.<br/><br/>Players are free to move around the board and tackle challenges however they see fit, but a lack of co-ordination will allow the darkness to creep over the city, and the Cataclysm to be at its strongest.<br/><br/>The Agents<br/>Players take on the role of an Agent. Play as the media-savvy Shadow, the noble Knight Templar, the mysterious Watcher, or the enigmatic Outsider, and employ your unique gifts to aid your fellow Agents.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm<br/>The goal in The Shadow Over Westminster is to save the city (and the world) from the oncoming Cataclysm. At the start, the Agents don't know what the Cataclysm could be, only that it's coming - but as the game progresses, the team can use their research, investigation, and special talents to uncover what doom approaches.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm is chosen randomly at the start of the game and placed face down until the Agents have done enough research and investigation to uncover the threat. Uncovering the Cataclysm is only half the battle - once uncovered, the Agents must overcome the Cataclysm's unique effect and drive the evil back out of this world, using the research, investigation, artifact, and talisman cards they've collected throughout the game.<br/><br/>With over a dozen cataclysms, who knows what the more malicious denizens of London are up to in the shadows.<br/><br/>Scales for 1-4 players to enjoy in 60-90 minutes.<br/><br/>",

First, a player may move one of their stones up to two spaces in any direction, including diagonally, in what is called a passive (or set up) move. Second, they take a more aggressive move, which must be the same direction and number of spaces as the first move. It is this second move that allows you to push stones across the board - or off the board's edge.

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!<br/><br/>On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.<br/><br/>",

A system of viable exoplanets has been recently discovered and the Confederations are flocking into space to colonize it. In this 2 to 4-player development and flow-management board game, you play the leader of one of these Confederations and play your influence in the Odyssey command station to send as many of your settlers as you can on these exoplanets.<br/><br/>After decades of research and technological development, humanity is preparing to leave the Earth to colonize this discovered system. To get there, only one possible means of transport exists: space gates. For reasons related to physics and other quantum aspects, these gates can be built only in space. The Confederations have therefore embarked on the construction of their own station in orbit, equipped with space gates.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the colonizing era, these portals make it possible to go on one of the first three discovered planets. As soon as an entire contingent of settlers has joined the gate of a space station, it is teleported to the corresponding exoplanet. The landing conditions vary according to the planets and the choice of colonized spots quickly becomes strategic.<br/><br/>As soon as one of the three exoplanets is fully colonized, each Confederation gains influence according to its placement, then access to one of the two later discovered exoplanets becomes possible. At the end of the colonization of the five exoplanets, the stations are teleported to the Hawking planet and the influence of each Confederation is assessed. The leader of the most influential Confederation will be promoted to the rank of Governor of this new system.<br/><br/>One of the biggest challenges in Space Gate Odyssey is your ability to quickly develop and intelligently arrange your space station. The better you optimize the flow of your settlers to your station, then to the exoplanets, the more of them you can send to the favorable spots and thus gain influence.<br/><br/>The choice of the modules, their arrangement, and the distance between the airlocks and the gates are therefore essential elements &mdash; especially since, at the end of the game, the domains of the modules you used to build your station will bring you additional influence points if they are in line with the position of the domains on the Hawking planet Predominance.<br/><br/>Finally, you must be careful not to leave too many open corridors on the space void as this represents a real danger for your settlers and could therefore damage your reputation.<br/><br/>Your most amazing quest starts with Space Gate Odyssey. Will you be able to take over your opponents in order to take control of the new system, or will you stay at the dock?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br/><br/>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.<br/><br/>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.<br/><br/>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br/><br/>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.<br/><br/>",

Star Munchkin is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks), and it can be combined with any other Munchkin items.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars. The same applies to Italian edition from Raven Distribution.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Star Wars: Imperial Assault is a strategy board game of tactical combat and missions for two to five players, offering two distinct games of battle and adventure in the Star Wars universe!<br/><br/>Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4. In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire&rsquo;s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.<br/><br/>In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empire&rsquo;s schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. You&rsquo;ll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle. Whether you recover lost holocrons or battle to defeat a raiding party, you&rsquo;ll find danger and tactical choices in every skirmish.<br/><br/>As an additional benefit, the Luke Skywalker Ally Pack and the Darth Vader Villain Pack are included within the Imperial Assault Core Set. These figure packs offer sculpted plastic figures alongside additional campaign and skirmish missions that highlight both Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader within Imperial Assault.<br/><br/>With these Imperial Assault and other Figure Packs, you'll find even more missions that allow your heroes to fight alongside iconic characters from the Star Wars saga. Boxed expansions add more heroes, imperial and mercenary groups, and totally new campaigns (see IA Community Wiki for a list), and the free Star Wars: Imperial Assault \u2013 Legends of the Alliance app provides you with additional content to play in solo or co-op mode.<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?<br/><br/>In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame. Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits.<br/><br/>While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship.

Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities!

A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.<br/><br/>(Note that Kosmos lists this game with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60 minutes.)<br/><br/>Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.<br/><br/>",

Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries. The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child's life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven't forgotten their childlike sense of wonder.<br/><br/>Stuffed Fables is the first &quot;AdventureBook Game&quot;, a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook &mdash; a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one! Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook. The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag. The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player. White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle. Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks. Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color. Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks. Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations. As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!<br/><br/>Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing. In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges. And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "The sultan has issued a decree: Whoever can build the most amazing palace in the city of Sultaniya will be made Grand Vizier. Become a character from 1001 Arabian Nights and build graceful minarets, dazzling gates and soaring cupolas to draw the eye of the sultan and carve your name in history. Players will carefully select the best building tiles to erect the most impressive structures, scoring points for following patterns and fulfilling secret objectives. Earn sapphires, and use them to secure the services of the mighty Djinn, whose aid will be invaluable in your quest to create the most stunning palace the city has ever seen.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>Players start out with a board, with a &quot;triangle&quot; of 3-tiles worth built, and have to expand that out to make the best (most VP-earning) palace. There are separate stacks of tiles for each layer of the palace, color coded (blue, red, green, and sky). Besides the color-coded levels, there are attributes that have to match up, like doorways and columns.<br/><br/>To get tiles, players reveal tiles from one pile and display them in front of the pile (up to 3 can be showing - the top of the pile is face up but can't be taken) and then choose a tile from any of the available tiles in any color. You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.<br/><br/>Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can't make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.<br/><br/>Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile. The player that scores the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach nine stars wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn players can use any of the button cards in front of them to gain extra movement, draw more cards, perform extra attacks, and block damage from opponents. Every time you press a button, you put a thumb token on that button card to show it's been used. You can press as many buttons as you like, but you can remove tokens from at most four cards at the end of your turn. Every other card with a thumb token still on it is then discarded, so pick your buttons wisely!<br/><br/>Aside from mashing buttons, you can play cards from your hand by paying the button cost of the card. Fighter cards are powerful and unique to your fighter. You can play multiple fighter cards on your turn as long as you have the buttons to pay for them, and if the last button on a fighter card matches the first button on the next card you play, you need to put a thumb token on that button only once! Pick the best cards to string together for a super-powered hit!<br/><br/>Super Punch Fighter includes a 1-2 co-operative mode called &quot;Minion Rush&quot; in which waves of minions try to overwhelm the board.

Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!<br/><br/>",

All players, all at the same time, pass their sketch to the next player, who must guess what's been drawn.

Players take on the role of trainee witches, such as Tiffany Aching and Petulia Gristle, learning their craft and dealing with all the problems, both petty and serious, that life on Discworld can throw at them. A subtle blend of headology, magic and, of course, the all-important cup of tea will see our heroines tackle everything from a sick pig to a full-blown invasion of elves. Each player tries to be better at everything than the others, while also cooperating to prevent crises from escalating.<br/><br/>Life can be tough for a young witch in Lancre. Fear not, however, as some of Terry Pratchett's most famous characters will be on hand to aid your quest. Along the way you'll meet Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick, as well as a rich supporting cast of familiar faces from the Discworld series. When things get really tough and you feel you are turning &quot;Black Aliss&quot;, you can always have a cup of tea with one of your fellow witches.<br/><br/>The Witches can be played competitively, cooperatively, or solo.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Adds several new aspects to Settlers of Catan but the two major ones are creating knights to protect the land from invading barbarians and building city improvements that confer benefits upon that city's owner. Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>The game changes the base game in three main ways:<br/><br/>First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.<br/><br/>Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)<br/><br/>Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.<br/><br/>",

Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.<br/><br/>The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.<br/><br/>In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.<br/><br/>You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.<br/><br/>Two promo cards are included in each copy of The Cousins' War: Guilds of London: The Secret Guild of Guildsmen and Snowdonia: Supply Wagon/Cannon<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;For once, Zeus, Greek god of thunder and sky, is in high spirits. Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus. To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment. Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters. The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.<br/><br/>Indubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean. But how could you find the righteous path onward? There is but one who can help you. Visit the mysterious oracle of Delphi and let her answers guide your ways.<br/><br/>In Stefan Feld's new game The Oracle of Delphi, the player's ships travel across a large variable game board of hexagonal tiles showing islands and the surrounding waters. Each player aims to reach certain islands to perform the twelve tasks given by Zeus: e.g., to collect offerings of different colors and to deliver them to corresponding temples, or to slay monsters of a specific type (and color), all of which can be discovered on the islands.<br/><br/>In order to execute these color-dependent actions, you are given three colored dice each turn, the so-called &quot;oracle dice&quot;. Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers. The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn. However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible.<br/><br/>In addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors.<br/><br/>Differently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.<br/><br/>",

The Red Dragon Inn 2 includes its own drink deck, player mats, counters, Gold, markers, and the following heroic adventurers:<br/><br/><br/>    Dimli the Dwarf: Grumpy, but tough and loyal, Dimli always seems to have a stash of gold secreted away somewhere. He can pretty much drink anyone else under the table. He's really, really good with his matched set of dwarven axes. He's not so good with darts, though. When he starts playing, duck. <br/>    Eve the Illusionist: Eve defies description, mostly because we don't know what she really looks like. Her powers of illusion have saved her friends countless times from the extremely gullible monsters of the deep dungeon. She's been known to use her skills on her fellow party members when she gets bored. <br/>    Fleck the Bard: Fleck is a dashing half-elf, ready with a smile or a song. His heroic tales and stirring lute-playing raises his friends' spirits, filling them with courage as they face the horrors of the deep dungeon. Fleck is always up for carousing, no matter the day or night. All the girls think he's so dreamy. <br/>    Gog the Half-Ogre: A hulking brute from the flinty mountains who unfortunately doesn't know his own strength. He's not the brightest torch in the dungeon, but he's a nice guy and he tries hard. Never, ever dance with Gog.<br/><br/><br/>",

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!<br/><br/>The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.<br/><br/>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.<br/><br/>Rule Correction:<br/><br/>For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.<br/><br/>",

Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.<br/><br/>Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.<br/><br/>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.<br/><br/>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions.

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.<br/><br/>Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.)

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe.

Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points.

        "gameDescription": "Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe &mdash; which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.<br/><br/>As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)<br/><br/>Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.<br/><br/>Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.<br/><br/>Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.<br/><br/>Part of Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players. Tigris &amp; Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.<br/><br/>",

To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent&rsquo;s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent&rsquo;s road: crossing over or crossing under it.<br/><br/>When crossing over : <br/>there exist no other roads over opponent&rsquo;s road<br/><br/>When crossing under : <br/>there exist no other roads under opponent&rsquo;s road<br/><br/>When either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway.

Using a junction, you may do the following.<br/><br/>\u2460 Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number<br/>You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.<br/><br/>Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!<br/><br/>\u2461 Branching out to two-ways<br/>You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.<br/><br/>Constructing Exit to Highway<br/><br/>If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.<br/><br/>Penalty<br/><br/>If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway<br/>The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.<br/><br/>2.

The oldest player in the group begins as the &quot;Facilitoaster.&quot;<br/><br/>The Facilitoaster begins the round by drawing a Tone Card, which determines the tone or style of the toast (some examples include &quot;Humor,&quot; &quot;Sincere,&quot; &quot;Tearjerker,&quot; and &quot;Roast&quot;).  All other players respond by submitting a Topic Card, face-down on the table. The Facilitoaster then reads the Topic Cards aloud and chooses the Topic Card that, in his or her opinion, best matches the Tone Card and deserves to be toasted. The player who submitted that Topic Card then delivers a toast and thereby wins a Tone Card for that round.<br/><br/>There are additional competitive aspects of the game. In the event that 2 or more of the same Topic Card is submitted in a round, the Facilitoaster has the option to call for a Toast Off, where the players who submitted the same Topic Card each give a toast. The Facilitoaster will award the Tone Card to the player who gave the best toast.<br/><br/>When the Top That Toast Tone Card is drawn, each player will give a toast based on the Topic Card that is selected by the Facilitoaster. Once all toasts are completed, the Facilitoaster chooses which player is awarded the Tone Card.<br/><br/>After each round, the role of the Facilitoaster rotates around the table. Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Tone Cards, that player wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/><br/>Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.<br/><br/>This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.  Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;<br/>&ndash; John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>Components (original edition):<br/><br/><br/>     228 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map <br/>     103 event cards <br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)<br/><br/>     260 full colour counters <br/>     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     110 event cards<br/>     2 six-sided dice<br/>     1 24-page rulebook<br/>     2 full colour player aid cards<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews<br/>MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/>     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames<br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card decks<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/>",

You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens &ndash; and you wouldn't say &quot;no&quot; to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.<br/><br/>Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.<br/><br/>Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.<br/><br/>Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.<br/><br/>",

Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.<br/><br/>Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.<br/><br/>If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!<br/><br/>At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as &quot;Food Rationing&quot;, call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as &quot;Hull Leak&quot;, call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.<br/><br/>During a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Warcraft boardgame features an adaptable/expandable geomorphic board, exciting components, and the innovative &lsquo;Command/Movement&rsquo; system that simulates the real-time action and excitement of Warcraft.&quot;<br/><br/>Warcraft is based on the computer game series. Each player takes on one of four factions: Humans, Orcs, Night Elves and Undead. It can be played cooperatively, with humans and night elves in one alliance and orcs and undead in the second.<br/><br/>The game is set up with a modular board, depicting resources, victory point locations and the players' town halls. Throughout the game, players need to harvest resources, build units and buildings, and use their army to defeat their opponents.<br/><br/>Each turn, players move their existing units, harvest gold and lumber with their workers, deploy units onto the board that were built on a previous turn, and finally spend resources on further units, buildings and outposts. Players also have access to a unique deck of Experience Cards, which are drawn during events like battles and can be used later for special effects.<br/><br/>A player can win by eliminating all opponents, or by accumulating 15 total victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Warsaw is a unique city. It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.<br/><br/>In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.<br/>     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.<br/><br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.<br/><br/>During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.<br/><br/>",

It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.<br/><br/>Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.<br/><br/>One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.<br/><br/>The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.<br/><br/>Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.<br/><br/>The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.<br/><br/>The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.<br/><br/>",

The trick is to make the best 5-dice &quot;hand&quot; from your two personal pocket dice and 5 up-for-grabs dice. Each roll could shift your strategy: will two pair become three of a kind or a full house? Will you go for broke with an all-in-bet?<br/><br/>At showdown time, the player with the best poker hand wins the chips. The ultimate hand is a Yahtzee flush: 5-of-a-kind in the same color &quot;suit&quot;!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player blind draws two dice from the bag and places them in his cup and shakes (his secret &quot;pocket&quot; dice), and they ante and bet based on their pocket dice. Then three more &quot;community&quot; dice are drawn and rolled (the &quot;flop&quot;), then a fourth (the &quot;turn&quot;), and a fifth (the &quot;river&quot;), with two betting rounds (of check, bet, call, call &amp; raise, fold, and all-in options) in between each draw. Dice combinations are similar to their poker counterparts and can give players; two pair, three of a kind, full house, straight, four of a kind, flush, Yahtzee (five dice of the same number in different suits), straight flush, and the &quot;Yahtzee Flush&quot; - five dice of the same number and suit (color), that automatically wins a player the game.<br/><br/>",

        "gameDescription": "Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.<br/><br/>In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.<br/><br/>Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.<br/><br/>The origin date listed for this game is approximate.<br/><br/>",

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.<br/><br/>The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.<br/><br/>The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).<br/><br/>The first team to 1,000 points wins.<br/><br/>",

Cards also have complete symbols for strength, faith, and food on them.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with two project cards &mdash; cards fueled by source tokens &mdash; and an empty 3&times;3 grid that shows semi-circular source symbols around the edges. The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you draft three cards. At the end of the second, third, and fourth rounds, all players compare their strengths in various horizontal or vertical rows on their grid.<br/><br/>In the first round, you draft three project cards, each with special effects that can be used if you fill all the source symbols on it. In each of the next three rounds, you draft and play three building cards. When you play a building card and complete one or more source symbols (by matching the colors on each half symbol), you receive a source token of that color for each completed symbol, which you must immediately place on a project.<br/><br/>After the third, sixth, and ninth building cards have been placed, you compare your strength in the row or column indicated on battle cards. (You have two such challenges after rounds six and nine.) The player with the most strength in the appropriate row or column receives 3 achievement points (AP), while the loser marks that row or column with a damage token. If a building card has damage in both its row and column, it's destroyed and removed from the game.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players feed their city, scoring based on the number of food symbols they have and the number of non-destroyed buildings. Players also score AP for faith symbols in their city.<br/><br/>M\u016b also contains rules for a solitaire game.<br/><br/>",
