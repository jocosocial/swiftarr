So much so that\, on JoCo Cruise at least\, small degrees of sharpness and flatness are measured in "Boggias." This morning\, Jim Boggia will sit on the Sea View Pool deck and turn his finely-honed tuning ability upon your ukulele—or any other stringed instrument* you bring him—until it is tuned to a degree of perfection usually reserved for the finest Stradavariuses.\n\n[Note from Paul: I'm really hoping someone brings him a harp or a full-size grand piano.]
