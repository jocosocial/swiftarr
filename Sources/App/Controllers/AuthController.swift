/// The collection of `/api/v3/auth/*` route endpoints and handler functions related
/// to authentication.
///
/// API v3 requires the use of either `HTTP Basic Authentication`
/// ([RFC7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617)) or `HTTP Bearer Authentication` (based on
/// [RFC6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1)) for virtually all endpoint
/// access, with very few exceptions carved out for fully public data (such as the Event
/// Schedule).
///
/// This means that essentially all HTTP requests ***must*** contain an `Authorization` header.
///
///  - Important: The query-based `&key=` scheme used in v2 is not supported at all.
///
/// A valid `HTTP Basic Authentication` header resembles:
///
///	 Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
///
/// The data value in a Basic header is the base64-encoded utf-8 string representation of the
/// user's username and password, separated by a colon. In Swift, a one-off version might resemble
/// something along the lines of:
///
///	 var request = URLRequest(...)
///	 let credentials = "username:password".data(using: .utf8).base64encodedString()
///	 request.addValue("Basic \(credentials)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
///	 ...
///
/// Successful execution of sending this request to the login endpoint returns a JSON-encoded
/// token string:
///
///	 {
///		 "token": "y+jiK8w/7Ta21m/O8F2edw=="
///	 }
///
/// which is then used in `HTTP Bearer Authentication` for all subsequent requests:
///
///	 Authorization: Bearer y+jiK8w/7Ta21m/O8F2edw==
///
/// A generated token string remains valid across all clients on all devices until the user
/// explicitly logs out, or it otherwise expires or is administratively deleted. If the user
/// explicitly logs out on *any* client on *any* device, the token is deleted and the
/// `/api/v3/auth/login` endpoint will need to be hit again to generate a new one.

	/// (returned by `UserController.createHandler(_:data:)`) values.
	///
	/// The use case is a forgotten password. While an API client has probably stored the
	/// information internally, that doesn't necessarily help if the user is setting up another
	/// client or on another device, and is even less likely to be of use for logging into the
	/// web front end.
	/// 
	/// Upon successful authentication, the user's password is set to the `newPassword` value in the provided
	/// `UserRecoveryData`, the user is logged in, and the users' login `TokenStringData` is returned
	/// (the same struct returned by `/api/v3/login`).
	///
	/// - Note: The `User.verification` registration code can only be used to recover *once*.
	///   This limitation is to prevent a possible race condition in which a malicious
	///   user has obtained another's registration code. After one successful recovery has
	///   been executed via the code, subsequent recovery can only be done via the recoveryKey
	///   provided during initial account creation.
	///
	/// - Note: To prevent brute-force malicious attempts, there is a limit on successive
	///   failed recovery attempts, currently hard-coded to 5.
	///
	/// - Parameter requestBody: `UserRecoveryData`
	/// - Throws: 400 error if the recovery fails. 403 error if the maximum number of successive
	///   failed recovery attempts has been reached. A 5xx response should be reported as a
	///   likely bug, please and thank you.
	/// - Returns: `TokenStringData` containing an authentication token (string) that should
	///   be used for all subsequent HTTP requests, until expiry or revocation.
