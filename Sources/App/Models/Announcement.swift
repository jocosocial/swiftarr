/// 	Admins can create Announcements, which are text strings intended to be shown to all users. All announcements have a 'display until' time,
/// 	and are considered 'active' until their display until time expires.
///
/// 	Announcement IDs are ints, and increase with each announcement created. The `User` model stores the highest Announcement ID the user
/// 	has seen.
///
/// 	Announcements are global, and are retrieveable while logged out. However, endpoints returning announcement data will only return all active
/// 	announcements for logged-out users. Logged-in users will additionally get data indicating which announcements are unread. Clients may implement
/// 	local solutions for determining which announcements are unread for logged-out users.
