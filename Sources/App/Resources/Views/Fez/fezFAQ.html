					<p>If you want to play a boardgame, start a band, go on a shore excursion, eat at a restaurant, drink like a pirate,
					get some exercise, visit the spa, sing a song, craft a crafty thing, play shuffleboard, play basketball, or find pokemon,
					but you need more people, use LFG to find them. Create an LFG listing the thing you want to do, the time, and
					how many participants you'll need.</p>
					<p>If you're looking for something to do and want to meet some new people, check out the LFGs, find an activity
					that sounds fun, and join up.</p>

					<p>No. Your standup act needs more work, LFGs are meant for small groups doing an activity together,
					all the 'event' rooms on the ship are for actual Scheduled Events, and JoCo Cruise does not provide logistical or 
					technical support for LFGs.</p>
					<p>If your LFG idea is 'come listen to me talk', the thing you want is a Shadow Event.</p>

					<p>LFGs are not a reservation system of any sort. Luckily, LFGs have built-in chat, so you can 
					come up with a backup plan with everyone and meet somewhere else/play a different game/eat at a different restaurant.</p>
