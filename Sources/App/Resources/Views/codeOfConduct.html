				<h4>The JoCo Cruise Code of Conduct</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<p><b>Be excellent to each other.</b> Treat your fellow passengers with kindness and respect. This is an enthusiastic and supportive community, and it is all of our responsibility to maintain it. <b>JoCo Cruise is dedicated to fostering a diverse, safe and welcoming environment for all attendees regardless of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, body size or type, neurotype, physical appearance, or religion; this extends to your interactions with fellow attendees.</b> Invite people into your conversations and activities; be supportive when your fellow attendees try new things (or choose not to); participate, connect, help out. Events like these can feel lonely and intimidating when you’re new and don’t know anybody. Be welcoming, inclusive and friendly, and look out for one another!</p>
				<p><b>Don’t harass others.</b> We are not a community that tolerates harassment.  This includes (but isn’t limited to): any kind of physical, verbal, or psychological abuse; threats, intimidation, and bullying; slurs about race, gender, sexuality or ability; unwanted romantic attention, sexual harassment, and generally creepy or stalky behavior; and photographing anyone or engaging in physical interactions (hugging, tickling, backrubs, etc.) without consent. If someone asks you to stop doing something and you keep doing it, that’s harassment. We’re all responsible for making sure this doesn’t occur in our community.</p>
				<p><b>Be excellent to the ship’s staff and anyone you encounter at a port of call.</b> Remember that we share this community with others. Please don’t be the person who makes JoCo Cruise look bad to the HAL staff and/or the locals.</p>
				<p><b>Don’t steal things.</b> Obviously.</p>
				<p><b>Don’t use illegal substances or bring them onboard.</b> No exceptions.</p>
				<p><b>We’re here to help.</b> Don’t hesitate to reach out and ask for help addressing an issue. If the matter is related to the ship and its operations, or the health or physical well-being of passengers and/or crew, we must defer to the Oosterdam management. The ship’s management, the officers, and crew are all ultimately responsible for the safety and well-being of every person on board. We and they are all doing our best to ensure you enjoy your experience and that the values of our community are upheld.</p>
				<p>Our experience and expectation is that JoCo Cruisers act responsibly and look after one another. But in the event of a breach of this Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to take action, including (but not limited to) limiting access to events, expulsion without refund, and/or permanent banning from JoCo Cruise events.</p>
				<p>During the cruise, if you are subject to or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, contact any Helper or JoCo Cruise staff member; alternately, you can submit a Code of Conduct Violation Report form at the JoCo Cruise Info Desk. (You may submit this report anonymously if you prefer.) You can also dial 74501 from any ship’s phone. Off-ship, you can email conduct@jococruise.com. JoCo Cruise will make every effort to protect the privacy of anyone reporting a violation.</p>
