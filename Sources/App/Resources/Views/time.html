            JoCo Cruise will be making at least one time zone change this year. San Juan and Tortola are in Atlantic
            Standard Time while the rest of our voyage will be in Eastern Standard Time. Be careful when scheduling
            events
            that you take note of the expected time zone.

                        This should match clocks on the boat. But the Captain sets boat time, so if they don't match,
                        boat clocks are right and Twitarr is wrong.

            If the <b>Boat Time</b> and <b>Device Time</b> above are different, you should change the time zone on your
            device until they match. This should be in your settings somewhere. If you can't find it, ask a tech nerd.
            There's probably one nearby.
