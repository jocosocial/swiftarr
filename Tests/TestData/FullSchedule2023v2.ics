DESCRIPTION:From Drew: "The ocean world Fhloston is 98% water and the ms Fhloston Paradise is a lovely vessel. The temperature is tropical and flowing robes and gowns are common among locals and tourists (the non fish\, of course\, who mostly wear suits). "Tonight you are her passengers\, hailing from across the galaxy\, onboard for the Paradise’s annual Pride cruise. What is less known about the Paradise is that her unique propulsion system draws passengers from across the multiverse of sci-fi canons. Common traditions among guests on the Paradise include dancing in and around sumptuous bathing pools\, basking in the music spun by the ship’s DJ\, Riz Rollins\, and gargling Pan-Galactic Romulan Ale. "Safety note: the ships multiversal coordinates ensure its permanent existence\, imminent/past destruction\, that it is yet to be or never will be constructed\, and that every fourth wall onboard is in a state of quantum indeterminacy despite continued interaction with classical systems."
