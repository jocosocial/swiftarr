SUMMARY:Monkey Caching
DESCRIPTION:What is MonkeyCaching?  Cache hosts will "sponsor" a cache outside their room and provide a clue to their room number which will be listed on Twitarr. Clues may be mathematical\, fannish\, etc.\, but should be solvable without internet access. The Cache will consist of a standard MonkeyCache bag distributed by Polly Goldman with 3-5 small items initially "seeded" by the sponsor\, much like a GeoCache. Hunters must bring their own single small item to start caching. Take one\, leave one.  THIS MEETING IS FOR CACHE SPONSORS ONLY; MonkeyCaching will commence shortly after the meeting.  If you want to sponsor a Cache but have not signed up in advance\, there will be quite a few extra sponsor kits available. Sponsor kits consist of a MonkeyCache bag that is pretty distinctive\, a page of information for MonkeyCache hunters that will hang on the outside of the bag\, and a magnetic hook.

DESCRIPTION:New for 2020: It’s the RPG/Story Game Exchange!What is it?Sea Monkeys sign up to HOST a game and get assigned a table by the tabletop team. When we get on board\, Sea Monkeys review the game descriptions and sign up to play.What we learned with our 2019 RPG mega event was that there’s a TON of Sea Monkeys who want to play all types of RPGs\, not just D&D. They’ll show up in droves if there is clear\, consistent information about the game they are signing up for and designated time on the schedule.Hosts: this is an opportunity to run an RPG or Story Game that you want to play. It can even be a GMless story game that you really want to try. Need some ideas? The tabletop team have put together a small collection of games in a variety of RPG/Story Game styles\, and there will be a raffle for game hosts who participate. More information and host sign up forms here.Players: This is a chance to play a game you love but with new people or to try something entirely new. Sign ups start on the ship when the game library opens.

SUMMARY:Theme: Formal Night
DESCRIPTION:Formal wear is encouraged\, but not required\, at dinner. "Formal wear" is defined VERY flexibly. Tuxedo and cocktail dress? Fine. Sport coat and slacks? Sure. Starfleet uniform? Awesome. Full Scottish regalia? Bonnie. You get the idea. Fezzes and tiaras are encouraged—but not required. (The wearing of fezzes and tiaras on Formal Night has become a sort of JCC tradition for many.)

SUMMARY:Game Exchange: RPG/Story Games
DESCRIPTION:New for 2020: It’s the RPG/Story Game Exchange!What is it?Sea Monkeys sign up to HOST a game and get assigned a table by the tabletop team. When we get on board\, Sea Monkeys review the game descriptions and sign up to play.What we learned with our 2019 RPG mega event was that there’s a TON of Sea Monkeys who want to play all types of RPGs\, not just D&D. They’ll show up in droves if there is clear\, consistent information about the game they are signing up for and designated time on the schedule.Hosts: this is an opportunity to run an RPG or Story Game that you want to play. It can even be a GMless story game that you really want to try. Need some ideas? The tabletop team have put together a small collection of games in a variety of RPG/Story Game styles\, and there will be a raffle for game hosts who participate. More information and host sign up forms here.Players: This is a chance to play a game you love but with new people or to try something entirely new. Sign ups start on the ship when the game library opens.

DESCRIPTION:For years—decades\, really—the science fiction/fantasy canon was seen as largely the same few writers: Heinlein\, Asimov\, Clarke and Bradbury\, with a few others thrown in for taste. But now there is an entire generation of writers who came up with different foundational authors. The authors on this panel will talk about their canon—i.e.\, the authors who influenced them—and how the slow transformation of the established "canon" of foundational authors is changing science fiction and fantasy...if it's changing at all.

We’ll show you why we love our obscure hobby with some history and a few representative (which is not to say simple!) examples.This event is a lecture/demo/Q&A session\, not participatory.

SUMMARY:Looking (Safely) at the Sun in H-alpha
DESCRIPTION:DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN\, ESPECIALLY NOT THROUGH BINOCULARS\, A TELESCOPE\, OR ANY OTHER OPTICAL DEVICE. With that out of the way\, let's look at the Sun through a telescope\, except this one has a filter which rejects most of the harmful energy and only lets through Hydrogen-α light which allows us to view detail on the Sun's surface\, and possibly some prominences.

DESCRIPTION:An introduction to the subtle wizardry that is gag cartooning. We will cover idea generation\, joke-craft\, and picture-making in service of the single-panel format. If we do this right\, you’ll walk out with a stack of ideas and sketches that you’re excited about. If we do it wrong\, I will be tied to the prow of the ship and left to the manatees. Worried about your drawing skills\, or lack thereof? Don’t be—some of the best cartoonists really can’t draw worth a whistle. But we’ll cover a bit of technique\, I promise.NOTE: attendance limited to 30 people. Fill out our JoCo Cruise 2020 Workshop Signup Form by March 1 to apply; applicants will be notified whether or not they have been randomly selected to attend from the pool of this workshop's applicants.
