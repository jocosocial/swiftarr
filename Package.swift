/// Because I have discovered and forgotten this 3 times now, and because it's difficult to find the answer as it's Google-obscured:
///
/// To make changes to a package and test them in Swiftarr, checkout the package locally and replace the `.package(url:...)` line with `.package(path: "<filepath>")`.
/// Accessing the package this way also makes it not process any version restrictions.
/// The path is rooted at the Package.swift's directory, may include `../..` and can probably include absolute paths.
/// 
/// I'm calling this solution 'google-obscured' because there's tons of info out there on how to edit a package that's part of a `.xcodeproj` project file, and the method to do that
/// is very different than how to do it with a `Package.swift` project.
