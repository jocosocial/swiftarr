# Twit-arr Pre-Embarkation Registration

2.  A computing device such as a mobile telephone, tablet, or laptop.

## Account Creation

Accounts are new every year. Instructions are provided below for web and native iOS/Android devices. We suggest using the native iOS/Android apps first with web as a secondary option.

### iOS

You can use the same steps as Web above or one of the native apps:

* [The Kraken](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-kraken-a-twitarr-client/id1496322373)
* [Tricordarr](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tricordarr/id6754777522)

The Kraken does not support Pre-Embarkation Registration at this time. Follow the Web and/or Tricordarr (Android) instructions above for those respective tools.

We suggest downloading both apps before sailing and trying both out on-board. Not all features are available in all apps.

## Available Actions

These are the features available during Pre-Embarkation Registration.

### User Profile

View/create a user profile for yourself. For example you can add a picture or avatar, pronouns, contact info, a bio, and more.

### Schedule

If the schedule has been released you can also Follow events in the Schedule tab to add them to your daily planner and receive in-app notifications once on-board.

### Read Performer Bios

Read about the official guests and performers that will be on-board with us.

If you are hosting a shadow event, see below for more information specifically for you.

### Favorite Users

Tricordarr only. Add the usernames of your friends to a quick access list. This also enables them to call you on-board using KrakenTalk™, the Twit-arr voice communication protocol.

### Help Manual

Tricordarr only. Read about all the features that will be available within the app once we embark.

## For Shadow Event Organizers

You can optionally create a separate performer profile that is linked to your shadow event. This may be displayed along with event information. Your Performer Profile is unique and unrelated to your User Profile (see information above). It is also not publicly linked to your User Profile. 

The Performer Profile can only be created once the schedule has been released. If you are presenting a shadow event and we have the schedule: Use the web or Tricordarr to go to the Schedule page and find your event. Click on it then press *Set Organizer* (or long-press in the app) Fill out as much or as little as you’d like then press *Submit/Save*. If you are hosting multiple Shadow Events you can press *Set Organizer* on all of them to link to your Performer Profile. You can only have one Performer Profile for all events.
